            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y verie good Lordes, as Sainct <hi>Iohn</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth vnto vs two ſorts of children, of whome he calleth the one the children of God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the children of the deuill: ſo doeth the holie Scripture plainly teſtifie, that in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there ſhall bee a maruellous difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the one and the other. For the one ſhal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibly and eternally be bleſſed, and the other extreamely and infinitly accurſed and wretched. This difference which ſhall then appeare betweene the children of God and the children of the deuill, doth aduertiſe and admoniſh vs, that there ought alſo to be a great difference betweene them, euen in this life. And in deed euery one may well vnderſtand that the waie to heauen is one, and to hell another, and conſequently that the workes and affections of Gods children are of one ſorte, and the workes of the children of the deuill of another. Neuertheles, ſo brutiſh are many become, that they neuer think vpon this difference betweene the one and the other, neither in regard of this life, nor of the life to come. Others thinking ſlightly thereupon, do neuer take information of this difference, to vnderſtand it: Others ſomewhat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, are ſo dazeled with the gliſtering ſhew of the world, &amp; ſo carried awaie with the luſts of the fleſh, that they haue no care therof: Yea euen among the children of God, liuing in this peruerſe world abandoned to all wickednes, we ſee verie few that doo make ſhew of that difference, that in this life ſhould be betweene them and the children of the deuill. Now Saint Mathew in this ſentence, <hi>Amend your liues, for the
<pb facs="tcp:18664:3"/> kingdome of heauen is at hand:</hi> hauing comprehended the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie of the firſt Sermons of Ieſus Chriſt and S. Iohn the Baptiſt, doth to this purpoſe teach vs. Firſt, that all the duties of the children of God are contained in this word <hi>Amend:</hi> alſo that the ſame is it that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the difference betweene them and the children of the Deuill, in this life. Secondly, that the apprehenſion of the kingdome of heauen to be ſo neare vs, ought mightily to induce vs to Amendement. Vpon this conſideration, to the end to correct the negligence, or rather the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes of men in this point, I haue vpon this argument framed theſe fower books: In the firſt, ſhewing how many dangerous follies there are that hinder man from Amendment. In the ſecond, Wherein we are to Amend. In the third, who ought to Amend: And in the laſt, haue I laid down the cauſes that ſhould induce vs to Amend our liues, gathered out of the names and attributes of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; out of this reaſon by him ſelfe ſet downe, <hi>For the kingdome of heauen is at hand:</hi> The whole tending to make vs to vnderſtand and indeed to practiſe the difference which euen in this life ought to bee betweene vs and the children of the Deuill: to the ende to hope with incomprehenſible ioye to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde for our ſelues the moſt bleſſed ſeparation that ſhall bee betweene them and vs, when wee ſhall bee lifted vp into the fruition of the eternal glory that is prepared for vs in the kingdom of heauen. And vpon three principall reaſons haue I reſolued and emboldned my ſelfe to preſent &amp; ded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cate them to your Lordſhips. The firſt is generall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in three points. Firſt, in conſideration of the ſeruent zeale &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection that you doe teſtifie to the preſeruation and maintenance of the true and pure religion: Secondly in regard of your iuſtice and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke gouernment, adminiſtred with ſuch diſcretion, wiſedome and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, that al your louing Subiects are in dutie to acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to be bleſſed therein: Thirdly in reſpect of your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courteſie, which you vouchſafe to extend to the faithfull, fled into this towne: who liue vnder your authoritie and gouernment in as great caſe, libertie and freedome, as poſsibly they might in their owne natiue countries: Which example of your clemency is alſo ſeconded by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous humanitie of your ſubiects towards thoſe that are harboured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. The ſecond reaſon is in reſpect of the French Church, to the ſeruice whereof it hath pleaſed God to call me. In that your Lo. haue
<pb facs="tcp:18664:3"/> permitted &amp; authoriſed the holy publick miniſterie with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to the ſame: That you haue prouided the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a larg &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient Church. That you giue maintenance to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for three miniſters: Laſtly that you exerciſe and performe a verierare and true Chriſtian charitie to the poore of the ſame Church. And this your wonderfull charitie, with other the vertues before noted, do I here ſet downe, firſt to the end that all and euery the members of the ſaid French Church, may more and more perceiue how deepely they are bound to bee your faithfull and obedient ſubiects: Secondly that they may vnderſtand and the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently put in practiſe their dutie, in feruent praier vnto God for your health and proſperitie: Laſtly, that all other Magiſtrates may in heart bee moued to imitate the example of thoſe vertues that ſhine in your Lordſhips. The laſt reaſon is particuler to my ſelfe: in regard of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that you had to retaine me to the ſeruice of this Church, which your ſelues vouchſafed to teſtifie, in that beſides your liberalitie extended to the two other miniſters, you offered to prouide me alſo both of a houſe &amp; maintenance: As in effect it pleaſed you at my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to make demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of your fauor, liberality &amp; affection towards me in that behalf. Whereupon all ſuch graces as God hath vouchſafed to beſtow vpon me, being in reſon &amp; vpon iuſt cauſe vnto you due &amp; vowed: I haue formed and doe acknowledge my ſelfe bound to dedicate and preſent theſe my fower bookes of Amendment of life vnto you: to the end that being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed vnder your name, they may witneſſe as wel my bounden dutie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: as alſo my deſire (according to my ſmal habilitie) to employ my ſelfe in the ſeruice both of the Church and your Lordſhips. Beſeeching God, moſt magnificent and vertuous Lords to maintaine you in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protection, and with his holy ſpirite to guide you in all your affaires, with increaſe of all proſperitie both ſpirituall and corporall. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly ſo farre to fauour me with his grace, as ſo to bleſſe this ſmall worke, together with the affection wherewith it is vnto you preſented, that being acceptable to your Lo. It may eſpecially redound to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt. From your town of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. This laſt of Iune. 1594.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Out of this Sermon therefore, conſidering the propertie of the word which Ieſus Chriſt doth vſe, we gather two things: the firſt, that it is an extreme folly to liue according to the fleſh, and ſo to giue ouer our ſelues to ſinne: and contrariwiſe, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wiſedome is the feare of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18664:6"/> and turne to God, and doo workes worthie amendement of life.<note place="margin">Act. 26.20</note> This phraſe of ſpeech teacheth vs, that mans life reſembleth a pilgrimage, wherein whoſoeuer offendeth God, by walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world and the fleſh, he doth (as it were) turne his back to God, to heauen, and to life: and goeth to the deuill, to death, and to hell fire. And contrariwiſe, that conuerting and turning to God by Amendement of life, hee turneth his backe to death, to hell, and to the deuill: and goeth to God, draweth neere to him, and directeth his courſe to heauen &amp; to life euerlaſting. Is there therefore anie greater fooliſhnes than to offend God? that is to ſaie, to turne from God and life euerlaſting, and to go after the deuill and death? If anie man ſhould voluntarily call himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, or into ſome riuer, either ſtab himſelfe, or drinke poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, men would not ſaie that he were a foole, but rather that hee were frantike and beſides himſelfe: What ſhall wee then ſaie to thoſe, who willingly offending God, do caſt themſelues into hell fire, and into the bottomleſſe pit of eternall death? To the ende therefore that we may amend, it is requiſite that we retire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert vnto God, and returne to him. But how? Euen by ceaſing to offend him, and by walking according to his word: for ſo do we turne backe from the deuill, from death, and from hell, Let vs, I ſaie, conuert and turne vnto God, yea, let vs drawe neere vnto him: yet as Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, not by changing of place,<note place="margin">Proſper in his ſentences out of S.

Now notwithſtanding we might note many examples of this folly, yet at this preſent we will conſider onely of ſeuen of the chiefeſt.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18664:8"/> perſecution wherewith Gods children toward this end of the world ſhall be tried: when theſe monſters ſhall ſcorne their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and conſtancie, in refraining from euill, vpon their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope in God, and for feare of his name.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But as there is no wound more mortall, than the ſame that plucketh foorth mans heart or ſoule, ſo is there no poiſon or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence of greater force, ſodainly in men to kill all faith, hope, &amp; charitie, with the feare of God, and conſequently to caſt him headlong into the pit of hell, than to deny the principle &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all religion, namely, that there is a God. To the end therefore to arme the elect againſt ſuch an extreame and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temptation, &amp; to make thoſe that ſhall ſuffer themſelues to be carried awaie with ſo bitter a temptation, the more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the daie of iudgement: we will produce againſt theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi> ſundrie witneſſes, againſt whom no exceptions can bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and firſt, all Iewes and Chriſtians, becauſe they allow of the olde Teſtament: ſecondly, all men liuing: thirdly, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well thoſe that haue eſſence onely, as thoſe that with eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence haue life, and thoſe that with eſſence and life, haue motion and feeling: and laſtly man, although he ſpeake nothing, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his eſſence, life, and motion, is alſo indued with reaſon. And in deed, the creation, preſeruation, and guiding of all theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doo with a loude voice proclaime that there is a God. And firſt we will begin with thoſe that allow the olde Teſtament to be the word of God, and conſequently with all Iewes and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that are, or euer were. For as in the olde Teſtament, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies that there is a God are moſt euident, infinite, and of ſundrie ſortes, ſo is it a deſperate preſumption and impudencie, to go about to denie that, which by ſo many millions both of Iewes and Chriſtians haue euermore beene beleeued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If theſe <hi>Atheiſts</hi> do ſaie, that both Iewes &amp; Chriſtians haue all bin deceiued by beleeuing the holy Scripture, whether of the olde or new Teſtament, and conſequently all teſtimonies of the diuinitie therein contained: What booke haue they ſo authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or ancient as the Bible, wherwith they may, to the contrarie, proue that there is no God? Againe, how can they ſhun the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction of their owne conſciences, which will force them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the holie Scriptures proceeded from God, if they wil conſider but theſe reaſons folowing. Firſt, they make no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18664:8"/> doubt whether the bookes attributed to <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Polibius, Liuie, Demoſthenes, Cicero, Homer, Virgil,</hi> &amp; ſuch others, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by thoſe men to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be attributed. What reaſon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue they to demand whether the Bible were written by <hi>Moſes, Ioſua, Eſdras, Dauid,</hi> the Prophets and Apoſtles? They alſo (at the leaſt in general termes) do approue the contents of the ſaid prophane bookes, whether for hiſtorie or for doctrine. With what mallice are they then poſſeſſed, that ſhould cauſe them to denie a God, which is the principall and fundamentall argument of all the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles: eſpecially conſidering that if this foundation ſhould bee falſe, all the reſt were but lies and vanitie. Likewiſe, theſe men that regiſtred the holy Scriptures, neuer labored after the glorie of man by oſtentation of anie new inuention: For al of them, euen from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Apoſtles, haue had one &amp; the ſame matter ſubiect of their writings, namely, this ſelfe ſame diuinitie. Neither haue they ſought after glorie, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nobilitie of deſcent, or vertues: but haue ſet downe, (as in ſundrie places we may perceiue) euen their owne infirmities and tranſgreſsions, yea, ſomtimes matter of reproch to themſelues, &amp; to their poſteritie. Prophane writers do ordinarily tend to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the vertues &amp; valiant actions of men, to the end to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the praiſe: But the holy ſcripture euery where tendeth to glorifie God, euen in euery thing that may beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in man: Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that al victories, deliuerance, aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to dignitie, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: to be briefe, that all goodnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of God, &amp; not of man.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5</hi> As concerning the contents of the holy ſcripture, it is the ſame that only laieth open the verie fountaine of mans corruption, &amp; that ſheweth how great and pernitious it is. The multitude and grieuouſnes of his ſins: The horrible puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they deſerue not only in this world, but in the world to come: Only this holy Scripture teacheth the aſſured remedy againſt theſe horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences: ſo that man feeling himſelfe worthie of all miſery, euen of eternall death, doth notwithſtanding find himſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent &amp; ioyfull in the midſt of the tribulations of this life, &amp; bleſſed in the aſſured expectation of an incomprehenſible &amp; eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This Scripture laboreth wholy to humble man, and to exalt God. It exhorteth man to renounce wickednes, &amp; to apply him ſelfe to righteouſneſſe: to deſpiſe preſent and temporall goods, that he may aſpire to thoſe that be ſpirituall, inuiſible, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. To be briefe, it teacheth as well true holineſſe and pietie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18664:9"/> towards God, as true loue, peace and concord among men, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorting them to theſe duties. Who is it then that ought not to haue a feeling of this in his owne conſcience, that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcripture proceedeth from God;</p>
               <p n="6">6 Moreouer, in other bookes we find counſels, exhortations, and reaſons to perſwade. Heer we haue expreſſe and preciſe commandements, wherby it appeareth that a ſuperior ſpeaketh, that giueth commandement to his inferior: namely, God to man. The holie Scripture preſcribeth a Law, not onely to the bodie or in externall cauſes, but alſo to the ſpirite, cogitations and affections of the ſoule: It is therefore the ſpirit of God that ſpeaketh, who onely hath dominion ouer the ſoule, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the affections and paſsions of the ſame. In this holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we find promiſes and threates of eternall weale and woe, as well to the ſoule as to the bodie. It is then the Eternall and the Almighty, that both promiſeth &amp; threatneth: This holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs the ſame thing, which the creation of the world doth: namely, that there is a God, almighty, all-wiſe, moſt good and beneficiall. He therefore that is the Auctor of the creatures, is alſo the Auctor of the holie Scripture. In this Scripture we find predictions of matters, which mans vnderſtanding could neuer foreſee: yea, the verie time of the performance of the ſame is many times noted, ſometimes a hundred yeares, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, yea, three thouſand, before they came to paſſe. Yet are they alwaies fulfilled in their due time: of neceſſitie therefore, God muſt be the Auctor of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Again, all the Philoſophers together in their many volumes haue neither ſaid nor taught ſo righteous, ſo holie, and ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie matter, as doth this holie Scripture in the ten wordes of the law: yea, euen in theſe two ſhort ſentences. <hi>That we ſhould loue God with all our hart, with all our ſtrength, and with all our ſoule: &amp; our neighbour as our ſelfe.</hi> From God onlie therefore muſt this doctrine proceed. The ſtyle likewiſe of this Scripture is ſimple and without affectation, and yet it penetrateth and pierceth the hart and conſcience, far more deepely then the writings of the moſt excellent Orators in the world. Whence ſhould ſuch effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie proceed,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.4.5</note> but from the ſpirit of God, which is the Auctor thereof. This is it that S. Paul expreſly noteth, ſaying. <hi>Neither ſtood my woord and preaching in the entiſing ſpeech of mans wiſdome, but in plaine euidence of the ſpirit and of power: That your faith ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18664:9"/> not be in the wiſedome of men, but in the power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 This holy ſcripture propoundeth vnto vs the hiſtory from the beginning of the world, with the doctrine euer ſince continued among both Iews &amp; Chriſtians: yet (which is wel worthy to be marked) we find no contradiction or diſagreement, either in the hiſtories or doctrine, that may not eaſily be vnfoulded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. But as for other books, they begin their Hiſtories two or three thouſand yeares later. And what diſcorde do we find in their writinges, both in their hiſtories and in their doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe, there are no books for the maintenance and confeſsion of the doctrine whereof, both men and women, euen by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands from age to age, Princes, marchants, artificers, learned and vnlearned, haue voluntarily reſolued, euen with cheerfulnes to abandon fathers, mothers, husbands, wiues, children, goods, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, yea, life it ſelfe, and ſuffered torments that cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by any one that is not holden vp by ſome diuine power. Yet heer may you behold Martirs, that is to ſay, authentical wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that this holie ſcripture proceedeth from God. This alſo is the reaſon, why of all other bookes, the Deuill, an enemie to God, and to the ſaluation of mankind, hath moſt endeuored to falſifie, to corrupt, and to aboliſh this holie Scripture: therby as it were confeſsing that proceeding from God, it is repugnant to him, &amp; neceſſarie for mans ſaluation. And yet hath the ſame bin miraculouſly preſerued and kept in his integrity, euen with the danger of their liues that were guardians thereof: yea, which is more, euen by the Iewes themſelues, the ſworn enemies to Ieſus Chriſt, of whom the Law &amp; the Prophets do beare witnes. And therfore S. Auguſtin compareth them to Stationers, who in their ſhops do keep many books, but for the vſe of other men. They haue bin preſerued therefore vndoubtedly by his only proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who was their Auctor. And to this purpoſeis the example of the time of Antiochus moſt notable: For in his daies,<note place="margin">1. Mac. <hi>l.</hi> 57 59.</note> namely in the hundred and fiue &amp; fortieth yeare of the Grecian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, did they deface and burne all the books of the Law that could be found, and yet within two yeares after,<note place="margin">1. Mac. 3.37 48.</note> euen in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeuen &amp; fortieth yeare of the ſaid Monarchy, was the book of the Law fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d again among the Iewes. Yet who did euer obiect either to the Iewes or Chriſtians, that the bookes of the old &amp; new Teſtament, were foiſted in or inuented by men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> becauſe they would deny that ther is a God?</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:18664:10"/>9 Againe, many of thoſe that from time to time haue made warre againſt the holy Scriptures, ſeeking either to falſifie or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to aboliſh the ſame, and perſecuted the profeſſors thereof, haue felt the ſmart of Gods horrible iudgements poured vppon them, and departed this life in moſt wonderfull &amp; terrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which (no doubt) was a vengeance that God, the author of this Scripture, executed againſt them. As in deed many of them haue bin likewiſe forced of themſelues to confeſſe their torments to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of God, ſtretched forth to puniſh their impietie. By the premiſes therefore it ſufficiently appeareth, that the diſaduowing and denying of the holy Scripture to bee the word of God, proceedeth not of ignorance, but euen of peruerſe obſtinacie and mallice, and therefore that we haue iuſtly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo many millions both of Iewes &amp; Chriſtians, profeſſors of this holy Scripture, as witneſſes that there is one God, againſt all thoſe that in mallice reiect the ſame, leaſt they ſhould be forced to confeſſe that there is a God.</p>
               <p n="10">10 If this ſuffice not, we will ſecondly produce for witneſſes all people &amp; nations of the world, that haue bin ſpred ouer the whol earth from the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world to this day. For they all with one conſent, do acknowledge that there is ſome God or Gods. A certaine philoſopher &amp; heathen Orator hath written, that there is no nation ſo barbarous, as not to confes that which theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do denie, namely, that there is ſome God, and theſe bee his words. Among all men of whatſoeuer nation, this is one conſtant and reſolute opinion, that there be Gods: for it is a matter euen borne with man,<note place="margin">Cicero in his ſecond book of the nature of Gods.</note> and (as it were) grauen in his ſoule. What theſe Gods are, there are ſundrie opinions, but that there are Gods, no man doth denie. And all his ſecond booke hee applieth to proue that there are Gods. All philoſophers, hiſtoriographers, &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets do make mention of theyr Gods, whom they inuocate &amp; call vpon. Would man, who by nature is proud &amp; ſtout, ſtoope to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of wood, ſtone, ſiluer, or gold, either offer anie ſacrifice to the ſame, or looke for any goodnes in the ſeruice and worſhip of them, if this opinion, that there is ſome God, whom if they think to proſper, they muſt inuocate and call vpon, were not grauen in his heart? Admit moſt men throughout the whole world do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip falſe Gods, yet doth their ſaid worſhip teſtifie that this is common among them, to beleeue that there is ſome God. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that in their ſeuerall opinions, they all do ſuppoſe that they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18664:10"/> worſhip one true God, &amp; ſo do manifeſtly condemne thoſe that thinke there is no God. Which is more: Euen the diuerſitie of Gods that is in the world, doth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare, that to beleeue a diuinitie, is no doctrine learned in the ſchoole of man, neither anie agreement among men: but rather that nature (the common mother of all) hath taught them that there is a God, &amp; thus they that denie it, are no partakers of mans nature. Moreouer, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the oth that is commonly in vſe with all nations, either for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the truth, or for the true performance of what ſoeuer is inuiolably promiſed, is another plain proof, that al men liuing doo confeſſe that there is a God, who knoweth the ſecrets of all harts, loueth truth, and puniſheth falſehood.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Some replye, that whatſoeuer the worlde beleeueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, proceedeth onely of the craft and pollicie of thoſe that haue ſought to purchaſe authoritie for their laws &amp; decrees, vnder colour of communication with the Gods, from whom, ſay they, they haue receiued whatſoeuer they haue commanded to men. But this gloſſe which they pretend, would bee of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with men, were not this perſwaſion, that there are Gods, whom they ſhould feare to offend, firſt grauen in their harts. For had they not beleeued it, they would boldly haue ſcorned thoſe that ſhuld boaſt of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with the Gods. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen thoſe men who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they charge with ſuch policies, are alſo witneſſes that al men do beleeue that there is a God. Again, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe al books that euer wer writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world to this day, and ſee how many notable perſons we ſhall find that euer maintained this blaſphemie, that there is no God.<note place="margin">Plut. in the decrees of Philo. li. 1. c. 7 Cicero in the firſt booke of the nature of Gods.</note> Well do they make mention of one <hi>Diagoras</hi> a <hi>Melian,</hi> and a poet: of one <hi>Theodorus</hi> a <hi>Grecian:</hi> of one <hi>Ephemerus</hi> a <hi>Tegaean,</hi> &amp; ſome others accounted to be <hi>Atheists.</hi> But why were they ſo accounted? Not becauſe they vtterly denied a God (for euen <hi>Diagoras</hi> beginneth his verſes with a confeſsion, that all things are ordered by a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:) but rather for that they ſcorned the Idols &amp; multitude of Gods. As <hi>Ephemerus</hi> was termed an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> becauſe he writ that the Gods of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> haue beene excellent perſonages, whoſe portraitures hauing bene reſerued for remembrances, were after conuerted into Idols. We alſo read that <hi>Protagoras</hi> the <hi>Abderite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cicero in his firſt booke of the nature of Gods.</note> for writing in the beginning of his booke, I wot not what to ſaie, whether there bee Gods, or whether there bee none, was by the commandement of the Athenians baniſhed their towne and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18664:11"/> &amp; his bookes openly burned: whereby many were made more ſlacke in the profeſsion of the like opinion, conſidering that the only doubt whether there were Gods, could not eſcape puniſhment. True it is, that certain Philoſophers tearmed <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> called the ſame againe into queſtion. But the reaſon was, becauſe their profeſsion was to doubt of all things, euen of thoſe which they did both ſee and touch, yea, and whether themſelues were or were not. They that beleeue not their owne ſenſes, that blacke is blacke, that fire is hot, that ſnowe is white, that iſe is colde: in briefe, that doubt of euerie thing that is, and whether each thing be ſuch as we ſee it, feele it, heare it, &amp;c. are ſurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide of ſenſe, and yet not ſo ſenſeleſſe as the Atheiſtes: for thoſe men doe but doubt whether there bee Gods, but theſe men doo vtterly denie that there be anie. Thus wee ſee the teſtimonies and confeſsions of all people and nations in the worlde, for the ſpace of fiue thouſand yeres, (for ſo long it hath continued) who all with one conſent do condemne the blaſphemie of thoſe, that to the contrarie dare affirme, that there is no God.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Moreouer, the very deuils do beleeue that there is a God, and doo tremble,<note place="margin">Iam. 2 19.</note> as ſaith Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> And heereof we haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies among the writings of the Heathen. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Apollo</hi> that God, or rather deuill, ſo famous among the <hi>Ethnikes,</hi> ſayth thus. We deuils that haunt both land and ſea, do tremble at Gods ſcourge, vnder whom the whole worlde doeth quake. Theſe Atheiſts therefore are more incredulous than the verie deuils: and leaſt they ſhoulde tremble with the deuils, do choake vp all remembrance of God: yet hath experience from time to time, &amp; euen to this daie taught vs, that they which moſt impudently would ſeeme to beleeue no diuinity, haue bin &amp; are the firſt &amp; loudeſt confeſſers of the ſame, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer it vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to be reueled by thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, earthquakes, &amp; ſuch other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary works: for the horrible terror which then affrighteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen to cry out and confes, that their deniall of God groweth onely of their drouſines in his ordinary workes, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that being wakened by the extraordinary effectes of his power, with trembling and terror they acknowledge that there is a God. Againe, euen in Gods ordinarie workes, they doo by ſpeech confes that which they wil not beleeue. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay, it raineth, it ſnoweth, it haileth, it bluſtreth, it is hot, it is cold, &amp;c. If a man ſhould demand who doth all this, it would amaze them.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18664:11"/> And why? Becauſe it is a common perſwaſion with all men that it is God, &amp; that thoſe workes are proper to God onely. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, when at the entering into, or beginning of anie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, if a man ſhall ſaie, he writeth, he commandeth, he walketh, hee eateth, hee commeth. This were an inconſiderate phraſe of ſpeech, and would miniſter occaſion to demand who it is that writeth, commandeth, walketh, eateth or commeth. And why? Becauſe thoſe actions are common to many. But the other being proper to God only, men neuer aske, who haileth, who raineth, who ſnoweth, &amp;c. becauſe euerie man referreth thoſe workes to God. Thoſe likewiſe, who to the end to denie God, doo referre ſuch workes to nature, doo euen in their owne ſpeech condemne themſelues, in that they ſaie not, ſhe raineth, ſhee ſnoweth, ſhee haileth, as ſpeaking of nature: but doo ſaie: it raineth, it ſnoweth, it haileth, as ſpeaking of God. Concluding therefore this purpoſe: firſt, all Iewes and Chriſtians: ſecondly, all Heathen throughout the whole worlde, doo with one voyce confeſſe that there is a God: And laſtly, the verie Atheiſts them ſelues, both in trembling and ſpeech, doo many times acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that, which willingly they would deny, namely, that there is a God.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Now let vs go forward, and come to other creatures, yet comprehending man alſo, who all without ſpeaking ſhal teſtifie that there is a God. Of theſe there are four ſorts. The firſt haue eſſence onely, as the elements, the ſunne, the moone, the earth, the ſtones, and the water. The ſecond haue eſſence and life, and are called Vegetatiue, as hearbs, trees, and all plants. The third haue eſſence, life, and ſenſe, as ſoules, fiſhes, and other beaſts.

Beholde, heere is alreadie one abſurdity, which mans vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth gainſaie. As alſo it is a moſt reſolute point, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is eternall and without beginning, is alſo immortall, and without ending. That which is from euer, is alſo for euer. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing that is (God excepted) is by nature ſubiect to change, corruption, death, and end. Nothing therefore that is, is eternal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18664:12"/> &amp; without beginning, but God who giueth beginning &amp; eſſence to euerie thing that is. Moreouer, if that which is, had bin from all eternitie and without beginning, then muſt it of neceſsitie enſue, that the elementes, the earth, the water, euen ſo many things as are, muſt bee ſo many Gods, conſidering that nothing can be from all eternitie, or without beginning, but that which hath his eſſence of himſelfe, and conſequently, God onely. And therfore to denie a beginning in any thing that is, is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame to be a God, whereof it would followe, that for the denying of one God, wee ſhould bee forced to confeſſe that there be as many Gods as there be elements, ſtars, ſtones, grains of ſand vpon the earth, or drops of water in the ſea: If then wee muſt confeſſe, that anie thing that is, hath not euer bin, but haue had ſome beginning, then muſt it enſue, that there is a God, who of nothing hath made that that is, euen as it is written, <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God made heauen and earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.1</note> Thus wee ſee how that which hath eſſence onely, euen without life, ſenſe, or reaſon, doeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe without ſpeaking, euidently teſtifie, that there is a God, that gaue vnto it eſſence and beginning. And in deed anie thing that is, is either a creature or a creator: But if the creature preſuppoſeth and acknowledgeth a creator, and conſequently a God: Then do the elements the earth, the ſea, the ſtones, and in briefe, euery creature by his eſſence, teſtifie againſt the Atheiſts, that there is a God, their creator.</p>
               <p n="14">14 If they replie, that euerie thing that is, is of it ſelfe: we will demand, ſince when? If they anſwere, from all eternitie, how can they proue it? Beſides, they muſt make as many Gods, as there be things that haue eſſence, as is afore ſhewed. Otherwiſe it cannot be choſen but that they haue bin ſince ſome time. Which if they graunt, then let them tell vs ſince what time that that is and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not, made it ſelfe, and thereof lay downe ſome proofe.

Thus it followeth, that it is contrarie to all reaſon and mans capacitie, to ſaie that anie thing that is, is come of it ſelfe. And therefore we muſt grow to acknowledge a God, who only hauing beene from all eternitie,<note place="margin">Exod. 3</note> giueth eſſence to all that is.

               <p n="15">15 But let vs farther conſider euerie thing that is, in ſtate as it is. The Philoſophers are of opinion that the earth, together with the ſea, doo containe in compaſſe or circuit ſixe thouſand, three hundred Dutch miles. Alſo, that the bodie of the Sunne is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſixtie, and ſixe times greater than the earth. How great then is that heauen wherein the Sunne is contained? Or rather, how great is the higheſt heauen which inuironeth all other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens that doo compaſſe the ſame, wherein the Sunne hath his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, yea, and with a meruailous diſtance? How many ſtars bee there in the skie? How many drops of water in the ſea? Or how many graines of ſand vpon the earth? If all the men in the world, kings, or philoſophers, who haue not onely eſſence but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo life, ſenſe, and reaſon, cannot without matter precedent make one drop of water, one ſtone, or one candle. How can theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuch incomprehenſible greatnes as are the heauens, of ſuch wonderfull brightnes, as are the Sunne, the Moone, and the ſtarres, and ſo abundant as are both lande and ſea, hauing not ſo much as eſſence, giue to themſelues eſſence, yea, and ſuch eſſence as they now haue? Yet ſpeaking onely of eſſence, common ſenſe doth alſo denie that. Let vs therefore conclude, that there is a God almightie, who being of himſelfe, from all eternitie, in his time hath of nothing created both heauen and earth, according as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath affirmed, ſaying,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1</note>

               <p n="16">16 Moreouer, experience teacheth, that the heauens haue their motions: But whence come thoſe motions, euen motions of ſuch incomprehenſible ſwiftnes, that as we ſee by daily practiſe, the Sunne in foure and twentie houres compaſſeth the whole earth, and conſequently in one houre runneth two hundred ſixtie Dutch miles. Beſides, the heauen where the Sunne hath his abode, is from the earth 1202700. leagues. How many leagues then doeth hee dayly runne in his owne heauen? A matter incomprehenſible to mannes capacitie. But euerie motion, eſpecially in thinges that haue eſſence onelie and no lyfe, doeth of neceſsitie preſuppoſe a moouer that cauſeth the motion. And this doo wee plainelye ſee in the Earth, in Starres, in Water, &amp;c. which haue no motion, but from others.

Who placed the Sun, the Moone, and the Stars in their heauens and places? Who formed and continueth the double motion of the Sunne in all ſeaſons, from Eaſt to Weſt, from one pole to another? Who ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed the foure elements vnder the heauens, that the region of fire enuironeth the aire, the aire the water, and the water the earth? The nature of contrarieties is one to deſtroie another, as the water to quench the fire, and the fire to drie vp the water: yet are theſe four elements kept in ſuch accord, that of the ſame being mixed and vnited together, all bodily creatures are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and doo conſiſt, not conſuming or diſordering one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It muſt their needs be that there is a God, the creator, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer, and conducter of the elements.</p>

Can this wiſedome, conduct, and power, which doo thus ſhine in theſe workes, be found in anie thing that was not, to place it ſelfe in eſſence, and ſo to direct guide, and maintaine it ſelfe?

They proceed neither from the earth, from the ſunne, from the raine, no neither from the ſeed. The eie ſeeth it, the capacitie knoweth it. The whole therfore proceedeth from God.

If they anſwere, the egge: How came that egge without a henne? Or how could that which was not, make it ſelfe an egge? Or how did that which was an egge, hauing onely eſſence, giue it ſelfe life?

How therefore could the egge, if it were before the henne, bring forth the henne, conſidering there was neither cocke nor henne, as alſo that the egge had onely eſſence, but neither life nor feeling?

And this folly doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe many, and proceedeth of this incredulity, that confeſsing that there is a God, they doo not apprehend his diuinitie, that is, that by his prouidence he guideth all thinges, that hee is the ſoueraigne good and well dooing, that he is holy, that he hateth iniquitie, that he is righteous and will puniſh it, that hee is true and almightie to fulfil his promiſes, and to execute his iudgements, and in wiſdome infinite.

               <p n="8">8 The third proofe conſiſteth in this, That we repoſe more truſt in man than in God. And this folly proceedeth from three origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſprings. Firſt, wee are ſo brutiſh, that as beaſtes apprehend no more than is before their eies, ſo wee beleeue no more than wee ſee. We ſee that men haue meanes to helpe vs, but we ſee not God neither knowe his power. And this is the cauſe that we truſt more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18664:20"/> to man that promiſeth our ſuſtenance, than to God who promiſeth to prouide for vs,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.26.</note> &amp; neuer to forſake vs: yea, than to God who ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs the ſchoole of ſoules, hearbes &amp; flowers, of them to learne, that man being farre more excellent and precious in the ſight of God, ought wholy to reſt vpon him for his ſuſtenance and life.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Secondly, we are ſo addicted to the fleſh, that we accompt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be a bleſſing, but what delighteth the fleſh. And ſo when men do promiſe things fit and commodious for the ſame, we truſt to them more then to God, who promiſing many bleſsings, aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reliefe, doth not alwaies fulfill thoſe promiſes after the luſtes of the fleſh, but to the good of the ſpirite and ſaluation of the ſoule. Thus albeit he performeth to vs more then it ſeemeth he hath promiſed, namely ſpirituall and eternall gifts, in ſtead of carnall and temporall: yet can not our fleſh comprehend that hee hath fulfilled his promiſes. Thus when in ſickenes, pouerty or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, man promiſeth recouery, aſsiſtance or deliuery, we truſt more in him then God, who in his word maketh the like promiſes: For fleſh knoweth no other reliefe, ſuccour or deliuerie then that which is bodily, which God often times changeth into ſpirituall and euerlaſting, more excelent in deed, yet leſſe knowne to man.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The third cauſe reſteth in the time of performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. God in his wiſedome doth ſometimes vſe long delaies (as fleſh doth imagin) in the performance of his promiſes: Wherupon man naturally, whot &amp; impatient, beholding that which he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neerer and more redy at hand, truſteth more to man then to God.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.4.</note> Hereto we may add, that as S. Paul ſaith, Experience engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth hope. And therfore as man findeth helpe and reliefe in men, who being of abilitie, doe alſo loue him: And on the other ſide, knoweth not Gods prouidence, who ſeedeth, ſuccoureth and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth him from many inconueniences &amp; dangers: So he weeneth, that by experience he findeth more helpe in man then in God, &amp; therefore repoſeth more truſt in man then in God. Hereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that children leane rather to their father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God: That when the mother hath giuen her child, his breakfaſt, he is content and craueth not ſo much as may ſerue him for fiue or ſixe daies after, as looking that the ſhall giue him more the next day. Wheras contrariwiſe, albeit Ieſus Chriſt hath taught vs at our heauenly father to craue our bread for one day, yet wee would wiſh that he woulde euen this day giue vs prouiſion both of bread and clothes for al the daies of our life. Thus the wiſe with her children, liuing vpon her husbands labours, is at reſt: But if
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18664:20"/> he die, in lue of truſting to God, the husband of widowes, &amp; father of Orphans, ſhe houleth and lamenteth, as fearing hunger &amp; want. Thus when a father hath purchaſed ſom penſion for his childs life, or hath commended him to ſome friend that hath promiſed to ſee to him as to his owne, he departeth in more quiet, &amp; in more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that his child is well prouided for, then if he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended him vnto almightie God, who can neuer die, &amp; whoſe loue to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> child ſurmounteth all loue of man. Thus a weake Prince, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred alliance with ſome ſtrong &amp; mighty King, thinketh him ſelfe more ſafe, then if he were alyed with God, who promiſeth to be his protector and ſauour. Thus the ſeruant relieth vpon his maſter &amp; miſtris for his food &amp; wages: While we contrariwiſe, ſeruing God, are in continuall care for our ſuſtenance and life, vnleſſe we haue a gage in hand, namely, goods and prouiſion requiſite. Thus we can be content to deliuer three or foure hundred pounds to ſome mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant vpon his bare letter, in hope at the yeares end to receiue our mony againe with ſome profit: yet can not find in our harts to truſt God with ten crownes, when he ſendeth his children, the brethren of Ieſus Chriſt to aske them, with promiſe that he wil anſwere for them &amp; returne them with great profit that ſhal continue for euer.</p>

               <p n="2">2 This is a folly worthy great reproofe, that man endued with vnderſtanding, can yeeld a reaſon for the eſſence and life of other creatures, yet himſelfe being the moſt excellent of all others, wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not wherfore he liueth, or wherfore God hath giuen him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.

               <p n="3">3 To the end therefore that we may Amend our liues, we muſt be better aduiſed, and vnderſtand wherefore we liue. The holy Scripture teacheth vs, that there are three principall ends of mans life: Firſt, that he ſhould glorifie God: Secondly, that hee ſhould attaine to life euerlaſting: And thirdly, that he ſhould referre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of his vocation to the ſeruice of God. But as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is a requiſit &amp; neceſſary directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our liues to theſe three ends, ſo are we eſpecially to exerciſe &amp; employ our liues in the knowledge of God, to the end that knowing him, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our liues to the ends aforeſaid. As concerning the firſt and ſoueraine dutie, which is to glorifie God, it conſiſteth in this. That with our mouthes we confeſſe, &amp; in our works we doe ſhew, that in our harts we accompt him to be as he is, &amp; as he declareth himſelfe towards vs. This doth S. Peter teach vs, where hee ſaith
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18664:25"/> that <hi>We ſhould ſhew forth</hi> both in words and workes,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.9:</note> 
                  <hi>The vertues of him that hath called vs out of darkneſſe into his maruailous light.</hi> But what are theſe vertues. That hee is a God almightie, all good, all wiſe, mercifull, holy, righteous and true.

                  <hi>For his mercy is multiplyed vpon vs, and his truth endureth for euer.</hi> That for the glorifying of God, we muſt in our hearts acknowledge, in our words confeſſe, and in our deeds declare him to be the ſame as hee is, it appeareth by the foure principall points wherein the ſeruice and glorifying of God doth conſiſt, and where to the ſame may be referred: namely, that we repoſe our whole confidence in him: that we obey him according to his will: that we call onely vpon him in all our neceſsities: and that we acknowledge al goodneſſe to come from him. This ought to be the principall end of our life.</p>
               <p n="4">4 God hath ſet open two moſt large ſchooles wherein hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth himſelfe vnto vs, that we may glorifie him as is aforeſaid. Firſt, the creation of the world. Secondly, the redemption wrought by Ieſus Chriſt. As touching the creation. God, where hee might haue contented himſelf with his glory which he had from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, vouchſafed notwithſtanding to reueale himſelfe to man, to the end that he knowing him, might confeſſe and magnifie him. He therefore created man to his owne Image and likeneſſe, to the end that by the beames of his brightneſſe, holineſſe, righteouſneſſe and truth, together with the dominion vnto him graunted ouer al creatures, he might be led to the knowledge of the ſon of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, goodneſſe, holineſſe, wiſedome and power: to loue him, to put his truſt in him, to obey his will, to call vpon him, to acknowledge that all goodneſſe proceedeth from him: and ſo to glorifie him. And whereas notwithſtanding the fall of man, God neuertheleſſe doth communicate with vs, cauſing vs to feele the wonderfull effects of his goodneſſe, wiſedome and power conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually and in all ſeaſons: withall,<note place="margin">Act. 17.21.</note> conſidering that in him onely we are, we liue and wee haue our motion: It were a moſt monſtrous caſe, that we ſhould not referre to his glory, our knowledge and feeling of him, which we gather in the communication of ſo many his graces, whereof he is both author and preſeruer.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moreouer, the creation of man was as it were his triumphant entrie into this godly pallace of the world, built only for him, to the end that the continual contempl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And in deed, if any man giue alms to the end to be ſeene of men, euerie one will confeſſe that his deed is nought worth. If a miniſter preach Gods word, onely to get reputation, &amp; not ſimply for the ſaluation of ſoules, he prophaneth his vocation:

               <p n="16">16 Why, will ſome man ſaie, Hath not God commanded euerie man to labour in his vocation for the maintaining of his family? It is true, but wee do miſconſter this ordinance of God. For his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that euery man ſhould haue this end, to ſerue God by the ſeruing of men. And in reward and recompence of the ſeruice that wee doo him, hee ordaineth that the artificer ſhall receiue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his labour, as from the hand of God, whom he ſerueth by ſeruing of men, and ſo may haue wherewith to maintaine his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: That the marchant ſhould ſell his commodities for more than it coſt, wherein the ſurpluſſage is the reward that God paieth him for his ſeruice. Likewiſe that the ſeruant, man or woman, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue food &amp; ſome wages for ſeruice don to God in ſeruing of men. Who ſo therefore maketh not this the end of his vocation, namely, to ſerue God by ſeruing of man, he doth not referre his life to the right end, and ſo prophaneth and peruerteth the ſame.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Heerein doo we greatly wrong our ſelues, for, if we liued to ſerue God in our vocation: beſides, that this ſeruice done to God, ſhould be rewarded in this life, it would alſo bee a path &amp; waie to attain to the inheritance of heauen, as Saint Paul teacheth vs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>The ſeruants that faithfully ſerue their maſters, doo ſerue the Lord Chriſt,</hi>

Yet not that this ſeruice in her vocation is anie merit, but onely a path wherethrough God leadeth her to the poſſeſsion of the celeſtiall inheritance, and a worke which ſhall not be without reward in the lyfe euerlaſting.</p>
               <p n="18">18 It is alſo a great conſolation to all thoſe that are called to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie baſe or vile office in this worlde, becauſe if they conſider that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18664:29"/> in ſeruing man they ſerue God, their vocation cannot bee baſe or vile in the ſight of God. His maieſty is ſo great, that there is no vile or contemptible office or calling in his houſe.

For as God is great, ſo doth hee greatly eſteeme of ſeruice done vnto him: And ſuch is the excellencie of his children, that they are not to imploie themſelues in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of men, were it not that they hope for better rewarde than from men. His will therfore is, that in ſeruing of men they ſhould looke for reward, not from men onely, but alſo from God, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that by ſeruing of men they doo ſerue God. And thus ſo long as wee direct the ende of our liues in this ſort to ſerue God, by ſeruing of men: wee ſhall neuer neede to doubt, or to take care for the maintainance of our bodies in this lyfe, but maye wholye repoſe our ſelues vpon ſo good a maſter, whome wee ſerue. And in deede, if the ſeruant that faithfully ſerueth his maſter is not to care for his neceſsities, but looketh, and that iuſtly, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whome he ſerueth ſhould prouide for the ſame, ſhould not we doo God great iniurie and diſhonor, if referring our whole liues to his honour, we ſhould feare that he would ſuffer vs to ſtarue?</p>

But as this ſparke of the image of God ſometimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light to our mindes, that all thinges depende vppon Gods prouidence, yet fall wee into this errour, to thinke that God in his

As for others, who attribute all to fortune and aduenture, and knowe no other good or felicitie but this lyfe, they lykewiſe fall into the ſame errour, as thinking all that proſper in this lyfe to bee bleſſed, and the afflicted to bee accurſed. And this cauſeth the wicked to flatter and harden theyr heartes in all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.

               <p n="3">3 What lykewiſe is the reaſon that ſo much people, yea, euen ſo many nations which profeſſe religion, doo giue ouer themſelues to vnlawfull traffique, to fraude, deceit, and other iniquities? Euen this, that they imagine that thoſe men which doo moſt abounde in riches and carnall commodities, albeit wrongfully gotten, are neuertheleſſe more bleſſed than the poore afflicted that walke ſincerely and vprightly. Our ſight is ſo thicke, and our eyes are ſo dimme, that we cannot penetrate beyond the outward proſperity, and come to the ſight of the iniquity that lurketh vnder the ſame, which is vndoubtedly accurſed by God, &amp; bringeth forth miſchief notwithſtanding whatſoeuer colour it be ſhaddowed and clothed withall.

               <p n="5">5 This folly alſo, to iudge by the outward apparance, is ſo much the greater, as that thereby wee doo conclude that wee are brute beaſts, voide of an immortall ſoule. Likewiſe, that beeing beaſts, wee are more miſerable than all other beaſts. Beaſts, fiſhes, or ſouls haue eaſier liues than men, eſpecially than the children of God, who aboue all other are ſubiect to tribulations. Theſe creatures wanting vnderſtanding, doo manye times paſſe ouer the whole courſe of theyr liues without feeling anie calamitie, vntill death, whereof likewiſe they haue no apprehenſion. They liue without care, ſorrow, or other paſsions that trouble man. And therefore if man, as beaſts, haue no immortal ſoule, theſe creatures are more bleſſed than hee, and conſequently, the wicked that liue at eaſe and in proſperitie, are much more bleſſed than the afflicted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, if after death they haue no feeling of good or euill. But if wee bee fully reſolued that man is not a beaſt, but hauing an immortall ſoule, is after his death to looke to go either to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or to hell, we will no longer by the outward apparance iudge that the beaſt, much leſſe the wicked man in all his triumph, is more happie than the afflicted children of God.<note place="margin">Luke 16.19</note> If afflicted Lazarus, and the rich man, triumphing in pleaſures, had had no immortall ſoules, men might with ſome reaſon haue adiudged Lazarus accurſed, and the rich man bleſſed. But that iudgement is to paſſe vpon beaſtes onely. For as for them, beeing no beaſts, but endued with immortall ſoules, albeit the rich man was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably buryed, and Lazarus with beggerie, yet the rich mans ſoule beeing caſt into hell fire, cryed out that hee was, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18664:31"/> and that the ſoule of Lazarus beeing by the Angels lifted into heauen, was &amp; is bleſſed. We read that Croeſus king of Lidia, inioying great abundance of wealth,<note place="margin">Plu. in the life of Solon.</note> and all other proſperitie that might make a man bleſſed in this worlde, on a time demaunded of Solon, one of the ſeuen wiſe men of Greece, whether he thought there were anie man more bleſſed than himſelfe. But Solon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that no man was to bee called bleſſed before his death. Rightly did Solon there reproue the folly of Croeſus, who thought himſelfe bleſſed in vncertaine proſperitie. As Solon lykewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted ſo wiſe, ſhewed his follye, by ſignifying in ſuch an anſwere, that Croeſus had bene bleſſed if he had continued in ſuch proſperitie vntill his death. Yet if Solon iudged that Croeſus coulde not thinke himſelfe bleſſed in all his proſperitie, what would hee haue iudged if he had beene a Chriſtian, and had ſeene the change of Croeſus proſperitie, not into that calamitie that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him when Cyrus afterward tooke him priſoner, but euen into hell and death euerlaſting? Might hee not, and that iuſtly, haue ſayd that Croeſus, notwithſtanding his proſperitie, euen albeit the ſame had ſtuck by him vnto his death, was neuer bleſſed, but moſt accurſed.</p>

And contrarywiſe, they which liued wickedly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly, were ſent into the priſon of iuſtice and vengeaunce, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tartarum.</hi> At the firſt, ſentence was awarded by liuing Iudges, and while men were yet aliue, but the ſame daie that they were to die. Howbeit there grewe ſuch abuſe heerein, that complaint was brought from the Ilandes of the bleſſed, that ſome were ſent thether, that had beene wicked and peruerſe liuers. And thereuppon was the occaſion of ſuch abuſe examined, which was ſounde to proceede of this, that iudgement was giuen while the men yet liued, clothed with honourable carcaſes, wyth riches, nobilitye, and other lyke qualities. In reſpect whereof they found many witneſſes, who making their apparaunce before the Iudges, affirmed for them that they were men that deſerued to paſſe to the ſayde Ilandes of the bleſſed. The cauſe of the errour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18664:32"/> once found out, it was decreed, that from thence forth ther ſhould no iudgement paſſe vntill after death, when the ſoules ſhould bee depriued of theyr bodies, and that alſo not by men yet aliue, and ſubiect to bee abuſed by the outwarde ſhew, but by ſpirites who ſhould ſee nothing but the ſpirits and naked ſoules of thoſe whom they were to giue ſentence vppon, to the ende that they which in this world had wrought wickedneſſe in theyr honourable bodies, clothed with nobilitie, riches, and ſuch other qualities, might bee ſent to tormentes: and contrarywiſe, that they who during theyr liues had kepte righteous, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This was the diſcourſe of a Heathen man, who had attained ſome ſight of the truth, albeit intangled in ignorance and errour, yet fitly confirming our argument, namely, that wee muſt not iudge of mannes felicitie or miſerie by the outwarde appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p n="7">7 This folly of iudging by the outward apparance, doth yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede farther. For it can take no place, (at the leaſt wherein to ſtay and ſettle it ſelfe in mans heart) but onely among thoſe that denie Gods prouidence, namely, thoſe that thinke there is no righteous God, that adminiſtreth iuſtice. For confeſſe that there is a God, and that hee is righteous, and thou canſt not iudge of mans felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or miſerie by the outward ſhew. Thou canſt not (I ſaie) iudge whether hee that liueth in proſperitie be bleſſed, or another in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction curſed. For ſith moſt vſually the wicked do proſper in this lyfe, and contrarywiſe the children of God haue moſt trouble, what ſhould become of Gods iuſtice, whoſe nature is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde euill to the wicked, and good to the good? A certaine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Verdune, in his Chronicle reporteth, that one Almauri, king of Ieruſalem, on a time demanded of a certaine Doctor, howe he could proue another life after this. The Doctor asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he beleeued there was a God: Which when he had graunted, It ſufficeth, ſayd the Doctor. For if there be a God he is righteous: if hee bee righteous, he muſt adminiſter iuſtice, in rewarding the good and puniſhing the wicked. Nowe thy ſelfe, ſayde hee, haſt knowen ſuch a wicked man, who alwayes liuing in pleaſure and honour, ſlept in peace. Thou kneweſt ſuch another, a verie good man, in continuall tribulation, euen to the death. If therefore there bee a righteous God, it cannot bee choſen, but there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyfe, wherein this good man reſteth nowe in bliſſe, and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18664:32"/> wicked man in woe. Whether this was a true reporte, or but a fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for example and doctrine, yet doeth it ſurely moſt playnelye teach vs, that hee that by outwarde proſperitie iudgeth a man to be bleſſed, and by tribulation to bee accurſed, denyeth a God, in that hee denyeth his iuſtice. The doctrine of this hiſtorie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doeth Saint Paul alſo confirme, ſaying, That the tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the faithfull, layde vppon them by the wicked that are in proſperitie, are a manifeſt teſtimonie of the iudgement to come, farre other than the fooles do by the outward apparance imagine. The reaſon hee alſo addeth, ſaying:<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1</note> 
                  <hi>For it is a righteous thing wyth God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you, and reſt to you that are troubled.</hi> Which iuſtice if it be not executed in this life, he concludeth, that it ſhal be in the latter comming of Ieſus Chriſt to iudgement.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is blaſphemie againſt God, ſayth Dauid, to ſaie that he will not regard mans tranſgreſsions, to puniſh them according to his iuſtice.

For if by outward apparance wee iudge the wicked man that is in proſperitie, to be bleſſed, and the good man that is in affliction, accurſed, we ſhall aboliſh Gods iuſtice, yea, euen God himſelfe. And this is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee noted, to the end that when the children and ſeruants of God doo finde themſelues ſometime pricked with this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may the better ſtand vpon their gard, with conſtancy to reſiſt the ſame.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eccle. 37.11.</note> In Eccleſiaſticus wee reade this notable aduertiſement. <hi>Aske no counſell for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of him that feareth not God: neither of iuſtice of him that hath no iustice: neither of a woman touching her of whome ſhee is iealous: neither of a cowarde in matters of warre: neither of a marchaunt concerning exchaundge: nor of a byer for the ſale: nor of an enuious man concerning thankefulneſſe: neither of the vnmercifull touching kindeneſſe: nor of the ſlouthfull for anye labour: nor of an hireling for the finiſhing of a worke: nor of an Idle ſeruaunt for much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: Harken not I ſaye to anye of theſe in any matter of counſell.</hi> If it be a folly to aske counſell of the man that is not ſo much our enemie as his owne friende in anie thing that may concerne his owne perſon or action: What a folly is it to follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of our enemies that labour onely after our deſtruction? Of ſuch enemies there are three principals. Who all are ſo much the more daungerous, becauſe they dwell in vs and round about vs, and to whome naturally wee are much enclined to giue credite. The firſt is ſelfe loue, or after the vſuall phraſe of the Scripture, our fleſh: the ſecond the worlde and the third the deuill.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As concerning the firſt.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.21.</note> Moſt certaine it is that all the luſtes of our fleſh are ſo many enemies, ſeeking to ſeduce vs, as faith Saint Paul, and fighting againſt our ſaluation. The ſame ſaith Saint Peter alſo,<note place="margin">1, Pet. 2.11.</note> where hee ſheweth how our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſtes doe fight againſt our ſoules:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> This enemie ſaith Saint Paule, is ſo daungerous and pernitious that hee engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth death and damnation in vs,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.14.</note> and therefore hee threte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs that if wee beleeue this enemie, wee ſhall die. Saint Iames, likewiſe compareth theſe luſtes to a wicked mother,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18664:35"/> that conceiueth and bringeth foorth iniquitie, and conſequently death. All which notwithſtanding, we grow ſo fooliſh and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as to giue eare and credit to our fleſh, rather then to God, whoſe loue towardes vs is moſt certaine and incomprehenſible. But I pray you, whereto doth our fleſh counſell vs? Onely, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet ritches, and to obtaine the ſame by any meanes, whatſoeuer, to aſpire to preheminence and excellencie aboue all others: to follow the pleaſures and luſtes thereof,<note place="margin">1.

That hee reſisteth the proude but giueth grace to the humble:</hi> Exhorting vs to take heede that our heartes bee not ouercome with ſurfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkenneſſe: pronouncing woe againſt whoremoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and adulterers. To be briefe, that in many places he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing vs to mortifie this our fleſh, to put it off, to denye it as an enemye that giueth vs deadly and damnable counſell.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neuertheleſſe let euery man examine his owne conſcience, and conſider the common courſe of men, and ſo iudge whether euery one in generall ſeeketh not to become riche, to grow into credit, and to be exalted aboue his fellowes: Whether they doe not loue and hunt after the commodities and luſtes of the fleſh: Whether they enuie not ſuch as get before them: To bee briefe, whether they giue not more credit to the counſell of the fleſh then of God. Experience is but ouer euident. The onely example and plaine confeſsion of Saint Auguſtine,<note place="margin">Auguſtine in his meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Cap, 4.</note> a man endued with great wiſedome and holineſſe, ſhall at this time ſuffice. Hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of couetouſneſſe, ambition, pride, pleaſure and other the luſtes and affections of the fleſh, ſayth thus: I haue a whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of traytors within mee, who vnder colour of friendſhippe are mine enemies. And yet beholde, with them haue I liued from my youth vp: them haue I pleaſed, them haue I beleeued, They bee the friendes whome I made much off, the maſter whom I obeyed, the Lordes whome I ſerued, the domeſticall ſeruants with whome I was conuerſant, the councelours whome I truſted. If therefore it bee ſuch a folly to beleeue our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, let vs heereafter bee more circomſpect and wiſer: Let vs no longer credite this enemye, which doeth ſo poſſeſſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18664:35"/> vs, that he is euen our ſelfe. But let vs beleeue God, our true and perfect friend, as knowing aſſuredly that all his counſels are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that all his commandements doe tend to our good and ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Our ſecond enemie to whom we giue too much credit, is the world. By the world, we vnderſtand the common courſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which is, to giue themſelues to wickedneſſe, regarding one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this preſent life, without any care of the kingdome of heauen. In reſpect hereof doth Saint Paul call the world wicked, and S. Iohn ſaith <hi>That the whole world is ſet vpon iniquitie.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſetteth before vs ſundrie examples of the corruption and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the world, ſaying. <hi>All that is in the world,</hi>

                  <hi>as the luſtes of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> By the luſts of the fleſh, he vnderſtandeth a deſire to liue at eaſe and delicately, without caring for any thing, but what may concerne the profit and commodities of this life. By the luſtes of the eyes he comprehendeth the vanitie of vnchaſt lookes, braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, pompe, &amp; other ſuperfluities. And by pride, ambition, haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, vaine confidence and ſelfe loue, euermore conioyned with the contempt of others.</p>
               <p n="5">5 This world is vnto vs a mightie and ſtrong enemie, in reſpect that being ſo corrupt and vicious, it inuiteth, and by the example thereof allureth vs to follow it, and ſo to abandon our ſelues to the ſame corruptions, wherein (ſuch is our folly) we are readie to beleeue it. And indeed experience ſheweth, how eaſily wee are drawne to confirme our ſelues ther to. The eaſe of the fleſh which ſome men doe enioy. The luſts and pleaſures wherein they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce. The riches that make them to be honored. The reputation to be mightier then others, with the banquets and ſumpteous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, doe all make a faire ſhew, whereby to flatter, moue and allure vs to follow them. And as euery one is readie to beleeue whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he deſireth, ſo doe we eaſily ſuffer our ſelues to bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to follow this world, whereto we are naturally enclined.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That the Adamant draweth the yron vnto it, is truly a ſecret of nature: but for the world to draw vs there to is a matter as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, as for the water of a riuer to runne downe the chanel, as for a chariot to runne downe a ſteepe hill: or ſeeing another yaune to yaune after him, or hering another ſing, to fall on ſinging. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally giuen to the corruptions of the world, we ſhall need no ſoliciting thereto, the onely ſight of the thing we loue, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to hale vs forward, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to force vs. As the wanton harlot
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18664:36"/> allureth her louer: the bayte vpon the hooke the fiſh: and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected aire infecteth all that liue in it. The worlde reſembleth a violent ſtreame, that carieth away all ſuch trees as haue taken no ſufficient roote. To bee briefe it falleth out with vs as with thoſe that liue among colliers or millers, who hardly can ſhunne defou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with collow or meale.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And indeed, it is but too common, that where wee ought through our holy conuerſation to allure the worldlings to follow vs, contrariwiſe the world being ſtronger then we, carieth vs away therewith.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.15.</note> Whereas it were our parts to ſerue as burning lampes, ſhining in the middeſt of a crooked &amp; peruerſe generation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to withdraw the worldlings out of their blind &amp; crooked waies into the pathes of light, truth &amp; ſaluation: contraiwiſe the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the world doth quench our light, and cauſe vs to wander in the darkenes. This doeth Chriſoſtome note, ſaying: If the good conuerſe with the bad, the good will ſooner grow worſe, then the bad better: alſo one ſcabbed ſheepe wil ſooner infect tenne cleane ones, then the tenne cleane ones will cure one ſcabbed one. Yet if we ſuffer our ſelues to bee ſo perſwaded by the entiſements of the world, that after the examples of others we do but a little neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the care of our ſoules that we may gather goods, and that wee follow others in the luſtes of the fleſh, in ſuperfluitie of banquets and coſtly attire: the golde, the ſiluer, the exquiſite moueables, the apparell and foode, will be vnto vs ſo many fooles cappes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads, crying out alowd that we are indeede very fooles, that will beleeue our enemie.<note place="margin">Iam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet, they that beleeue not that there is a God: they that eſteeme better of man than of God: they that thinke to liue euer, and yet know not wherfore they liue: they that iudge of mans felicity or miſery by the outward ſhew, &amp; they

               <p n="2">2 Yet may this folly be more generally conſidered, in that man (at the leaſt for the moſt part) thinketh himſelfe to be but a man, created for this temporall life, and not a Chriſtian, beleeuing lyfe euerlaſting. For therof it falleth out, that man being wiſe, diſcreet, and aduiſed, as concerning the worlde, yet a Chriſtian, fooliſh and ſenſeleſſe, in matter appertaining to life euerlaſting, thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wiſe, and is in deed but a foole, becauſe he is wiſe in the leſſe, and a foole in the principall: wiſe as concerning men, and this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, but a foole as concerning God and life euerlaſting. And we ſhall finde many preſidents, counſellors, aduocates, phiſitions, philoſophers, marchants and artificers, wiſe, diſcreet, and aduiſed in their arte and vocation, who all in the vocation of Chriſtianitie are but fooles, ignorant, and ſenſeleſſe. They are verie perfect in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning this preſent life, but ignorant and fooliſh in matter of lyfe euerlaſting. Neither is it anie maruell.

Beholde therefore, how weening to be wiſe, becauſe they bee wiſe men, they be but fooles, in that they be ignorant &amp; vnaduiſed Chriſtians.</p>

Likewiſe, ſpeaking of the Babilonians that carried &amp; worſhipped their Idols, he ſayth expreſly to the Iewes. <hi>Bee not yee like vnto them.</hi> As in deede with what conſcience coulde they haue worſhipped thoſe Idolles before men, when in theyr heartes they ſayde and proteſted before God, that hee onely and not the Idols was to be worſhipped?

For this cauſe doth the Deuill, our auncient enemie, labour to diuert men heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and to bring them out of taſte, ſaying vnto ſome, If God woulde ſpeake vnto vs either by himſelfe, or by his holie Angelles, wee woulde verie willingly beleeue and obeye him:

In the meane time, it is abhominable raſhnes and preſumption in man, to ſeeke to alledge reaſons againſt the expreſſe declaration of the will of God. Albeit we ſhould not vnderſtand for what cauſe God would ſpeake vnto vs by the miniſtery of men, or that thereby he would bring vs to ſaluation, yet might it become vs to humble our ſelues in his ſight, and without replying, to obey his commandements &amp; ordinances, as certainly beleeuing that to his elect hee appointeth nothing but in his wiſdome &amp; goodnes, to his owne glorie, and to their felicitie and ſaluation. And in deed firſt, euer ſince the fall of Adam, men haue bin ſo eſtranged from God, by reaſon of ſin and their own corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they cannot abide the preſence of God, eſpecially when he ſpeaketh to them.

And therefore is it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that the holye Ghoſt ſhoulde perſwade vs, that when vve heare men ſpeaking vnto vs, wee heare God ſpeaking by them, and ſo doo receiue their, worde, not as the woordes of men, but as the worde of God? In this ſenſe doth he alſo ſay, that the paſtors doo beare the treaſure of the heauenly doctrine (as it were) in earthen veſſels, to the end to trie our humilitie and faith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.7.</note> whether without reſpect of the baſe and meane eſtate of the men, wee can finde in our hearts to eſteeme of and accept the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſure which they preſent vnto vs. Secondly, is it not a great honour that God doth to man, when from among men hee choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome to bee his embaſſadors, &amp;, as it were, his owne mouth to preach and proclaime his will, together with the myſteries of our ſaluation, and to beare witneſſe of his great mercie, goodneſſe, and loue towardes vs, and of that eternall glorie which he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs in heauen?</p>
               <p n="8">8 Thirdly, the eſtabliſhment of preaching is an excellent &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient meane to maintaine loue, vnion, and truth among men. If there were no preaching but onely priuate reading of Gods word, we ſhuld preſently find a horrible confuſion in the doctrine, when euery one ſhall expound the holy Scripture after his owne ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding. As alſo by experience we doo but too plainly ſee that they which contemne preaching, doo finally fall into diuerſe opinions and errours. Heereto had S.

                  <hi>In the latter daies the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall bee prepared in the toppe of the mountaines, and all Nations ſhall flow vnto it, and many people ſhall go and ſaie, Come let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lorde, to the houſe of the God of Iacob, and hee will teach vs his waies, and wee will walke in his pathes.</hi> And that wee may inioye ſuch a benefite, let vs euen feele in our ſelues that burning affection and deſire, which that excellent Prophet Dauid had,<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4.</note> that with him we may praie to God to giue vs grace, that wee abide and remaine in his temple all the dayes of our liues.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Some there are that confeſſe, that indeed it is their duetie to doe this, but they can not reſolue, leaſt they ſhould be knowen to be of the religion, &amp; ſo looſe their goods, dignities &amp; otherworld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities. Is not the ſoule more precious then the body? Muſt we not haue more reſpect to the ſoule then to the body? In a time of famine we can be content to ſell al for bread, rather then to die for hunger.<note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> Did not the Egyptians giue all their money, their cattle, and finally their poſſeſsions to Ioſeph, for corne? Nay more then ſo, we will euen ſnatch bread out of the fire? And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if wee haue no other meanes, wee can bee content to leaue
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18664:49"/> countrey, kinred, and friends, &amp; to trauaile into forrein countries to ſeek for food, rather then to die for hunger. But why do we not as much for our ſoules. The famiſhed ſoule cryeth out, I muſt liue: And is it not meere raſhneſſe to think to liue without food? We muſt therfore forſake all, for to obtaine the ſpirituall food of the woord: we muſt euen wreſt it from out the fire and perſecution, or els depart into ſome other countrey, where it may be had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And thereto doth Ieſus Chriſt lead vs, when he ſaith, <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for the meat that endureth vnto euerlasting lyfe.</hi> Should we call in queſtion his promiſe, who ſaith, <hi>Seeke first the kingdom of God, and his righteouſnes, and all other things ſhalbe miniſtred vnto you?</hi> Hath he not effectually declared vnto vs, what care he taketh to feed thoſe that follow him to heare his word? Behold, there were ſower thouſand, beſides women &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that folowed him into the deſert to heare his doctrine: They knew not what to eate: but Ieſus Chriſt had a care thereof. <hi>I am moued in compaſſion toward this multitude,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for three daies haue they been with me, and haue nothing to eate, and I will not ſend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way faſting, least they faint by the way.</hi> Herevpon he bleſſed ſeauen loaues and a few fiſhes and gaue vnto them, ſo that they were all ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Some ſcorners and blaſphemers will ſay, let God take care for the ſoule, and I will take care for the bodie. But contrarywiſe, let vs ſay, Let vs take ſuch care for the ſoule as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and he will care for the bodie, as he hath promiſed. Let his promiſe be vnto vs as the pitcher of oyle, and the barrell of meale to the Widow of Sarepta, that neuer waſted: euen a more certain rent then the money in our purſes, or the goods in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>What will it profit a man to win all the world, and to looſe his owne ſoule?</hi> What a folly were it to buy a houſe for the bodie, laying out ſo much therevpon, that for want of goods the bodie ſo well hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed muſt die for hunger? Euen ſo, what ſhall a man get by keeping his goods for to feed and cloath the bodie, which is the houſe of the ſoule, and in the mean time ſuffer the ſoule to pyne away and die for hunger? Sith therefore the queſtion now dependeth vpon the amendement of lyfe, let vs reſolue to frequent and heare the preaching of the Goſpell, and ſo to feed our ſoules with the word of God, turning away our eyes from all incumbrances offered by the fleſh, and aſſuring our ſelues that we can catch no harme by obeying God, and ſeeking food, life, and ſaluation for our ſoules.</p>

S. Auſten rehearſeth three degrees of woe. He, ſaith he, that hath not that he loueth cannot be ſaid to be bleſſed. Neither he that hath that which he loueth, if his loue be hurtful vnto him: Neither he that hath that which is ſoueraignely good &amp; profitable if he loueth not that which he hath. Now as we may, to ſample the firſt, bring in thoſe who louing the holy miniſterie, haue no meanes to come by it, &amp; the ſecond, ſuch as loue ſuperſtition &amp; Idolatrie and do enioy it: ſo for the third, among others we may place thoſe that are in place where they may freely &amp; commodiouſly haue the vſe of the holy miniſterie of the word and ſacraments, but doe not loue it, &amp; therefore doe either neglect it, or peraduenture deſpiſe it. Theſe men ſhall incurre Gods double iudgement, for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; treading vnder foot the food of their ſoules &amp; the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible graces which God offereth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the preaching of his word They be men that thinke not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be men: for they liue as beaſtes, that care only for the body and this life, but make no accompt of the ſoule and life euerlaſting. If ſometime they come to a Sermon, it is but for a faſhion, becauſe it is an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to be of the religion.

               <p>NOw let vs come to the ſacraments. As concerning baptiſme, in as much as among all Chriſtians, except the Anabaptiſtes, the inſtitution &amp; ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, to baptiſte children, is obſerued, reſeruing to another place the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of not knowing, much leſſe practiſing the vſe of our baptiſme, wee will proceed to the ſupper. The ſupper was ordained principally for two reaſons. The firſt: As a mother hauing brought forth her litle one, doth not forſake it, but nurſeth &amp; bringeth it vp: So Chriſt hauing ordained baptiſme to bee as a ſeale &amp; pledge of our ſpiritual new birth into his Church, did inſtitute the holy ſupper, to the end that by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in his body &amp; bloud, we might the more be ſtrengthened in this aſſurance, that Chriſt is ours, together with all his benefits, &amp; ſo feede our ſoules ſpiritually to life euerlaſting. And indeed as ther is no ſaluation but in Chriſt, ſo doth not Chriſt any whit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit vs, except we belieue that he is ours, together with all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. Well is he preſented vnto vs in the preaching of the Goſpell, but ther be yet two other points, &amp; thoſe very notable, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy ſupper. For God who in his preaching ſpeaketh generally to al men, in his holy ſupper directeth his particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, &amp; as it were by name, to euery the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municants therin. And not ſo ſatisfied, he alſo deliuereth them a ſeale and viſible token to aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that his pleaſure is that Chriſt with al his benefits ſhould as certainely belong to euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they ſee, touch and tail that they be partakers of that bread &amp; wine that is deliuered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that careth not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in this aſſurance, that Chriſt with all his benefits is his, is poſſeſſed with too much pride, if hee thinketh it needles, either that he prophane it, as not feeling what a comfort and ioy it is to haue aſſuraunce of his ſaluation in Ieſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt. The ſecond reaſon is, that we preſenting our ſelues at the Lords table, may by ſo doing make as it were a publike proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we haue no fellowſhip with Idolaters and heretickes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the world: But that we take our ſelues to be the children of God, &amp; the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the body of Chriſt, that we looke for life and ſaluation through him onely, and ſo ſhew forth the benefit of his death, &amp; al this in remembrance of him to his glorie. The firſt reaſon declareth how neceſſary the vſe of the holy ſupper is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſelues: The ſecond, how requiſite it is to the glorie of God and the edification of our neighbours. We might alſo add a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18664:51"/> third reaſon: That is, that the holie Supper is a ſeale of our vnion &amp; knitting together into one bodie, vnder our head Ieſus Chriſt, as S. Paule expreſſely ſaith, That we who are many, are but one bread, and one bodie, becauſe we are all partakers of one bread. And thus thoſe men that voluntarily do abſtaine therefro, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue their ſoules of their food, Chriſt of his glorie, and by their euill example, doe miniſter offence to their neighbours. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: They ſeperate, or rather keep them ſelues ſeperate from the bodie of Chriſt. Hereby it appeareth, that they which be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and care not for communicating in the Lords Supper when he giueth them opportunitie, do deſerue not onely not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted members of Chriſts Church,<note place="margin">Nomb. 9.9.</note> but alſo to incurre the moſt horrible iudgement and vengeance of God: As God in old time declared by Moſes: That the man that did not celebrate his paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer ſhould be cut off from among the people, and beare his owne ſin, becauſe he offered not the offering of the Lord in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Againe, we ſee in ſundrie reformed Churches a number of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hearers of ſermons; but yet are there many more that care not for communicating in the Lords Supper, and that vpon ſundry conſiderations: firſt, ſome that liue in bad conſciences, in whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, theft, drunkenneſſe, or other iniquities, from which they are not determined yet to abſtaine, do forbeare the communion, as doubting leaſt they ſhould aggrauate their condemnation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as ſaith S. Paule,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation.</hi> Theſe men doe reſemble thoſe, who lyuing in fornication do refuſe to marrie, leaſt thereby their fornication, which they are not minded to giue ouer, ſhould be the more grieuous, as being conuerted into adultery. They may alſo be likened to thoſe, who hating their neighbours, when they ſay the Lords prayer, <hi>Our father which art in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> do leaue out this petition, <hi>forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them that treſpas againſt vs,</hi> as imagining that if they ſhould ſay that, they ſhould pray to God not to forgiue their owne ſinnes, becauſe they forgiue not their neighbours. But as they who lyuing in fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and will not marry, leaſt they ſhould forſake their adultery, are in a wofull eſtate: ſo the others that aske no forgiuenes for their tranſgreſsions, and ſeek to continue in hatred againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, are worthy double condemnation: one in reſpect of their hatred that they continue: the other, for their ſinnes, for the which they aske no forgiuenes. Euen ſo, they that forbeare the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in reſpect of their bad conſciences, do pronounce ſentence
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18664:51"/> againſt themſelues, namely that they deſerue double death: firſt, for their ſinne which they do continue in wicked conſciences: and ſecondly, becauſe they ſeperate themſelues from the communion of Chriſt, in whom onely is the fulneſſe of life. What ſhall they then doe? Let them put away their wicked conſcience: Let them diſſolue the bands of Sathan: Let them come forth of hell: If they ſay that they can not ſo farre maſter their affections: Why? haue they married themſelues to fornication, hatred, theft and other like iniquities, vpon condition that they will neuer be diuorced from the ſame? ſurely that is a token, that they do not ſteadfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beleeue that there is a hell prepared for ſuch liners. Or at the leaſt, the pleaſure that they take in their ſinne, doth quench all remembrance thereof. Otherwiſe, the ſole apprehenſion of this horrible and vnquenchable fire, would force them to giue ouer the wickedneſſe that leadeth and draweth them thereto. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if in a mightie tempeſt they ſhould chaunce to finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon the ſea in daunger of drowning, they would a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times proteſt to forſake their bad conſciences, that ſo they might ſubmit themſelues to the obedience of God. But how can they lie downe and ſleepe vpon a pillow of fornication, theft ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and other wickedneſſe, giuing themſelues as a pray to Sathan, if God in his long ſuffering ſhould not recouer them? Let them flatter themſelues at their pleaſures: for if they continue in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the pacience of God, and abſtaining from the holy Supper to the end to goe on in a wicked conſcience, their eſtate is moſt woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and accurſed. As he therefore, who wanting the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, and liuing in fornication, ought to abhorre it, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide himſelfe of a remedie by marriage: ſo as often as they haue aduertiſment, or heare of the celebration of the Lords ſupper, let them at the leaſt thinke themſelues wakened and ſummoned to renounce their wicked conſciences, and by participating in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupper, to ſeperate themſelues from the ſocietie of the wicked, to glorifie God, and to be confirmed in faith and courage, to goe forward from good to better.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Others doe forbeare the communion, becauſe they will not ſubmit themſelues to Eccleſiaſticall orders and diſcipline. If wee might admit of euery one indifferently, or that we would not care although afterward they liued other wiſe then might beſeeme the children of God, or were occaſion of offence to the weake, then would they ſurely come to communicate: But if they may not be admitted before they haue talked with ſome miniſter or elder
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18664:52"/> of the Church, yea &amp; peraduenture be forced to beare with ſome Chriſtian admonition, in caſe they do not afterward walke in the courſe of Chriſtianitie: they will rather chuſe to depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the communion. As alſo to the end to confirme them in this miſlike, they ſhall find ſome diſcontented perſons who to miſlike the order of the Church, will euen againſt their owne conſciences charge it with the title of a new tyrannie &amp; inquiſition. Yet muſt wee confeſſe that the Church of Chriſt cannot conſiſt without ſome order, and as S. Paul ſaith, <hi>All things must be done in order and decencie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.40.</note> If no Cittie, or familie can long continue without eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of ſome order and gouernment: Then the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that the Church is, the more neceſſarie it is therein to erect and obſerue ſome gouernment, which we tearme Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. Doctrine is as it were the ſoule of the Church, and order as the ſinnewes of the ſame to vphold it. If the Church which is Gods houſe muſt not be a receptacle and harborow for diſſolute perſons and vnbeleeuing vnthriſts, and as both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe termeth them a denne of theeues: Then muſt there bee ſome order,<note place="margin">Iere. 7.11. Mat. 21.13.</note> whereby to purge and preſerue it from ſuch.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Particularly, if the holy ſupper be ordained for the faithfull, the children of God and the members of Ieſus Chriſt: Such as haue the gouernment of the Church, muſt alſo haue ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that they that deſire to adioyne themſelues thereto and to communicate therewith, are taken to bee ſuch as approuing the puritie of the doctrine, doe not leade anie offenſiue life. And as for thoſe that are once admitted to the communion, they may continue therein by trying themſelues, becauſe by the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie we are to beleeue that they perſeuere in the faith, godlines &amp; loue, vntill either by reuolt from the doctrine, offenſiue conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or obſtinate refuſal of Chriſtian admonitions &amp; exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ſhew themſelues vnworthie the communion, whereto neuertheleſſe vpon teſtimonie of their repentaunce and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, they may bee againe admitted. Let thoſe therefore that ſtumbling at this order doe depriue themſelues of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, euen iudge in their owne conſciences, whether it bee not meete that order bee maintained, and all perſons ſubiected thereto, rather then to bring in ſuch confuſion, as indifferently to receiue to the Lordes ſupper all fornicators, drunkerds, theeues, murderers, and other like offenſiue people: whereof might enſue a moſt grieuous prophanation of the Lords table, to the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18664:52"/> as well of thoſe that ſo ſhall bee admitted, as of them that voluntarilie doe admit them. When Chriſt and Saint Iohn doe crie, <hi>Amend your liues,</hi> they ſpeake alſo to ſuch people, that they vnderſtanding how requiſite this order is for the happie conduct of the Church in the feare of God, accommodating themſelues thereto, may ſo diſpoſe of themſelues as to communicate in the Lordes ſupper to his glorie, and theyr owne comfort and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Some there are that voluntarilie doe abſtaine from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, becauſe they cannot, ſaie they, reſolue where the Church is, as ſtumbling at the infirmities of ſuch as doe communicate, and ſtill finding more faulte in the Church then in themſelues. Theſe men ſhaming to bee reputed either halfe Papiſtes, or of no Religion, doe ſometime frequent Sermons: but they ſtaie there, and ioyne themſelues to no Church. Yea they euen doe ſeeme to reioyce when they heare of any the offences or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of any of the members of the Church, that thereby they may haue ſome collour to ſtand a looſe. Yet muſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that there is a Church in the worlde, and that they muſt ioyne themſelues thereto, if they deſire to bee in Gods houſe, and partakers in the promiſes made to the Church: To bee ſhort, if they looke to bee ſaued. By alowing no Church, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate themſelues from the true Church that is vpon earth, and conſequently from the entrie into that which is in heauen. If themſelues ſhould be in the fieldes ouertaken with ſome ſharpe ſtorme of wether, woulde they ſtand ſtill and ſeeke no couert, vntill ſome great thicke leaued tree would offer it ſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them? Are they without fault? The onely pride that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, maketh them to condemne all Churches, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they ioyne themſelues to none, doth ſufficiently ſhew, that they are not reſtrained ſo much by the particular faultes of ſome of the Church, as by their owne offences and corruptions,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.1.</note> and conſequently haue ſuch a miſlike, that they thinke no bread good. In Chriſts Church which conſiſted but of twelue Apoſtles, there was one traitor:<note place="margin">Mat. 26.65.</note> There were ambitious diſputations who ſhould be chiefeſt in the kingdome of Chriſt: They all forſooke their maſter, and S.

               <p n="6">6 There is a certaine decree aſcribed to Zepherin Biſhopp of Rome, wherein he ordaineth that all Chriſtians ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at the leaſt once a yeere.<note place="margin">In the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.

Let them that we ſpeake of therefore conſider, by what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they may be called Chriſtians, ſith they neuer communicate in the ſupper of Ieſus Chriſt. Neither may they replie, as ſome doe, that in ioyning with one Church they condemne all others: for it is true that all aſſemblies that entitle themſelues the Church of Chriſt, are not ſo, yet to acknowledge or alow of none for feare of condemning of the reſt, is to denie and condemne Chriſt in not condemning thoſe, who calling themſelues Chriſt, are Antichriſts.

Where God calleth the temple the houſe of prayer, he ſheweth that the principall part of that ſeruice which he requireth of vs, is that wee ſhould aſſemble to pray and call vpon him, as indeed theſe publique praiers are of great efficacie. For albeit all priuate praiers directed to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, haue promiſe to be heard: yet is it not without cauſe that Ieſus Chriſt aduertiſeth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth vs, that if two faithfull doe agree vpon earth, whatſoeuer they demaund of their heauenly father, it ſhall be graunted. This is a fauour, as it were peculiar to the Church, and noted by Dauid, where he ſaith. <hi>Praiſe waiteth for thee in Sion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 65.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and vnto thee ſhall the vow be performed.</hi> Herein he ſheweth that the praiers of the Church ſignified by Sion, are ſo ſure to bee heard, that God who heareth them, looketh for praiſe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as indeed it is his dutie whoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are heard to yeeld thankes &amp; praiſings to God. And truely as when a whole Burgeoyſie of a Citie doe come before their Prince and with one voice craue pardon for ſome offence, or begge ſome grace or fauour, the Prince will be more moued, then if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent, ſome one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſpeake for the whole: Euen ſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole Church aſſembled together doth with hart and minde in the preſence of God acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie the praiers which the preacher, as the mouth of the congregation, poureth forth, let them be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that thoſe praiers do penetrate the heauens, and that God is moued to heare them. Not that he is ſubiect to paſsions (as we) but that by the feeling of our affections hee vouchſafeth to aſſure vs of his mercy &amp; goodnes toward vs. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Amb. de paeni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent.</note> diuers how few ſo euer ſaith S.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18664:54"/> haue euermore had their aſſemblies, &amp; therein publique pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers: This ſence or feeling being grauen in all mens harts that haue any religion, that they ought to call vpon their God: that it is an honour that God requireth at their hands: and the true meanes to purchaſe his bleſsings toward them. But in Chriſtian Churches there is alſo this farther reaſon: That their publique praiers are as it were a publique renouncing of all ſects and ſocietie with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and prophane people: an acknowledgement and confeſſion of the true God, &amp; a publique ſanctification of his name to his glory. And therefore,<note place="margin">Act. 16.13.</note> as the Iewes in old time, ſo ſince haue the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans euermore very carefully obſerued this dutie of pietie and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to God, as appeareth by the writings of the Apoſtles &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and by al Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories. And to this purpoſe doth S. Luke rehearſe that Paul and his companions being at the towne of Philippos, came forth vpon the Sabaoth day, and went to the riuers ſide where they vſed to pray. This vndoubtedly was ſome out corner where the faithfull vſed ſecretly to meete to call vpon God. So that albeit euery man priuately might haue prayed in his houſe,<note place="margin">Act. 21.5.</note> and ſo haue auoided both the paine and daunger, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in dutie they were to ſeparate themſelues from Idolaters, and the efficacie of the praiers of the congregation, they ouercame the feare of the danger, &amp; met in that place eſpecially to pray, and with one conſent to poure out their praiers to the Lord. When S. Paul and his companions departed from Tirus, all the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their wiues and children brought them out of the towne, and kneeling with them on the ſhore, prayed. Shall wee in theſe daies find this zeale among Chriſtians? No: men will bee aſhamed to imitate it and to kneele downe vpon a ſhore to pray to God publikely. And yet the faithful of thoſe times neuer did it without both reſon &amp; fruit.

As therefore by his example, we ought to ſeeke out all ſecret oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, wherby we may the more freely lift vp our hearts to God in praier: So when we find our ſelues alone, vpon occaſion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in the houſe, or in the fields, by night or by day, ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe ſhould be vnto vs as a warning and allurement by and by to thinke vpon God, that we may praie and praiſe him. For as the ſpirite cannot be Idle, ſo being alone from noiſe, companie, or companion to talke with, it giueth occaſion to the children of God that are not to much entangled in worldly affaires, to enter as it were into familiaritie with God, and to call onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>

And in another place proſecuting the ſame argument, he ſayth, Therefore I deſire you not onely to come hether often to heare the holye ſcriptures read vnto you, but alſo that in your owne houſes you take in hand the holy Bible, and with feruent deſire to profit, you receiue what ſo euer you finde therein. And ſoone after, Looſe not, I beſeeche you by your neglygence ſuch a commoditie, but euen in your houſes attend the reading of the holy ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Coloſ.

You that liue in the worlde, you that haue wiues and children, marke how the Apoſtle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you eſpeciallye, to reade the holye Scriptures, and that not ſlightly or for a faſhion, but plentifully and with great diligence. Then hee addeth, Buy the Bible, which is the medicine of the ſoul: at the leaſt the new Teſtament, the writings of the Apoſtles, the Acts, &amp; the Goſpels, that therein you may diligently reap dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruction, for the ignorance in the ſcriptures is the cauſe of all euill.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Others there are that care not for reading the Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therin they find no taſt or comfort: and this is an euill ſigne. For as hee that for a while hath beene kept eating, and therefore refuſeth good meat for want of appetite, muſt thinke that his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is not wel, ſo he that findeth no taſt in the reading of Gods word, may well feel that his ſoul is ſick. Yet ſhould he follow the counſel that the Phiſition giueth to his patient, to whom he ſaith, Eate, by eating your ſtomacke will come to you. But this theyr want of taſt proceedeth heereof, that they be not acquainted with the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo doo reſemble thoſe, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſermon, but not beeing perfect in the language, doo therein reape neither inſtruction nor comfort to ſaluation. It were good for thoſe men many times to heare God ſpeaking vnto them, by reading the holy ſcriptures, ſo ſhall they by little and little learne the ſpeech of the holy Ghoſt, euen as men vſe to learne other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, through the exerciſe of hearing, reading, &amp; ſpeaking. Some ſpices there are, which without bruſing doo yeld no ſmell, but the more they bee chafed the ſweeter they are: euen ſo is it with the holy ſcriptures, ſuch as reade but little, can finde no taſte, but the more they bee peruſed and read, the more doo they yeelde foorth the treaſures and pleaſant fruites hidden in them. And in deede, ſayth Chriſoſtome, the cauſe why many doo vnderſtand nothing, procedeth not ſo much of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as that they wil not dayly haue
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18664:61"/> the writings of the Apoſtles, or reade them. That which we know,<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome in his preface on the Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> ſayth hee afterwardes, if wee knowe anie thing, commeth not ſo much of the excellencie of our vnderſtanding, as of this, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were tyed to the writings of the Apoſtle, we neuer leaue reading them. If you therefore will in heart applie your ſelues to diligent and earneſt reading, you ſhall vnderſtand that which you deſire, For the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Seeke and you ſhall finde,</hi> is true.</p>
               <p n="10">10 It is likewiſe a vaine and friuolous excuſe to alledge, that the holy Scripture is darke and profound, and that we vnderſtande it not. Plato, ſayth Ierome, writ for few,<note place="margin">Hiero on the 86 Pſal. To. 8. Chriſo. in his 3. ſermon of Lazarus.</note> and few doo vnderſtande him: but the Apoſtles writ not for few, but for all. And therefore Chriſoſtome ſaith, Truely the grace of the holy Ghoſt hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and moderated the holy Scriptures, that both publicanes, fiſher-men, tent-makers, ſhepheards and Apoſtles, fooles, and men vnlearned, may by thoſe bookes bee ſaued. Leaſt alſo ſome foole might haue recourſe to anie excuſe in the difficultie therof, he hath vouchſafed that the thinges there ſpoken, ſhoulde bee eaſie, and that handy-craftes men and ſeruantes, widdowes, and the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant among men, ſhoulde reape ſome benefit and profit by the reading thereof. For they whome God from the beginning hath accounted worthy the grace of the holy Ghoſt, haue not ſet down all theſe things for anie vaineglorie, like the Heathen, but for the ſaluation of their hearers. The Prophets and Apoſtles haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their bookes eaſie &amp; plaine, as publike Doctors for the world, ſo as euerie one may learne their contents by reading and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely. Againe, how wilt thou vnderſtand the contents of the Scriptures, when thou wilt ſcarſe ſo much as looke vppon them? Take the bookes in hande, reade the whole hiſtorie, remember ſuch thinges as are playne, and referre darker places to another time. But if by continuall reading thou canſt not finde the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, get thee to ſome wiſer man, or to ſome Doctour, and impart to him thoſe thinges that are written, declaring thy feruent deſire: then if God ſeeth ſuch a readyneſſe and diligence, albeit no man woulde teach thee, yet woulde he himſelfe vndoubtedly declare them vnto thee. Remember the Queene of the Aethiopians Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, who albeit hee was a Barbarian,<note place="margin">Act. 8.28.</note> a man troubled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cares, one that vnderſtoode not what hee read, yet woulde not paſſe his iourney without reading, howe much leſſe beeing at home in his owne houſe? Alſo if hee read ſo diligently when hee

Neither wyll God at this time deſpiſe our deſire to profyte in his woorde, but wyll make vs to feele the fruite of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>They ſhall all bée taught of God.</hi> And therefore ſayth Saint Auguſtine,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.45 Auguſtine of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> the holye Ghoſt hath ſo moderated the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that hee hath prouided to remedie the darke places, by others more eaſie and playne.

And yet ignoraunce in other Artes is no hinderaunce but in this life: but ignoraunce in religion is hurtfull to the ſaluation of the ſoule. That wee are ſo feruent and earneſt in applying our mindes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſciences, and yet in that which is moſt neceſſarie for vs, and as it were, the fortreſſe of our ſoules, wee are ſo negligent and ſlouthfull. This ſayth hee, cauſeth the heathen to remaine obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their errors, and to skorne our religion: For they ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to maintaine falſehoode, and wee not knowing how to defend the truth of our doctrine, they conceiue that ours haue no ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and thereof doo take occaſion to blaſpheame Ieſus Chriſt, as if he cunningly abuſing the ſimplicitie of the people had decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and circummented them.

               <p n="13">13 Now as negligence in reading the holy Scriptures breedes this offence, ſo is there yet another greater and more daungerous: And that is that wee ſtill abide in the former corruptions of the world and the fleſh, wheras contrariwiſe we ſhould reſemble bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning torches, to giue light to the poore and ignorant, wee ſhould, <hi>I</hi> ſay, be wholy renewed &amp; rauiſhed in ſpiritual &amp; heauenly buſines:

               </head>
               <p>WE will begin with loue, which hath two reſpects. The firſt is to God,<note place="margin">Math. 22. 1. Iohn. 4.19 Ephe. 2.4 Rom. 5.8 Iohn 3.16</note> as it is commanded, that wee ſhoulde loue him with all our heart, with all our ſtrength, and with all our mind. The ſecond, to our neighbour, whome wee ought to loue as our ſelues. As for our loue to God, the ſame, as Saint Iohn ſaith, proceedeth of his loue to vs, <hi>We loue him becauſe he first loued vs.</hi> He loued vs euen when we were dead in ſinne, when we were his enemies, yea, <hi>hee ſo loued vs, that he gaue his onely begotten and welbeloued ſonne to die for vs.</hi> This his incomprehenſible loue toward vs, doth therefore bind vs moſt feruently to loue him. And in deed, as a colde ſtone by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng three or foure houres in the warme Sunne, gathereth heate, ſo this loue of God ſhining vpon our ſoules, ſhould kindle them in his loue.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.16 1. Ioh. 4.7 Iohn. 13.33 Auguſt. vpon Iohns goſpel. 1. Cor. 13</note> As for loue toward our neighbor, we are the rather to deſire it, and to put it in practiſe, becauſe it is the marke of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore ſayth Saint Iohn, <hi>God is loue, and he that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God.</hi> And as all Gods children are the diſciples of Chriſt. <hi>Heereby alſo</hi> (ſayth Ieſus Chriſt) <hi>ſhall men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as I haue loued you.</hi> They that are not my diſciples, ſaith Saint Auguſtine in the perſon of Chriſt, doo notwithſtanding participate in many other my benefites. They haue not only nature, life, ſenſe, reaſon, and common preſeruation among al mankind, but alſo the gift of tongues, the ſacramentes, propheſie, knowledge, faith to worke miracles, diſtribution of their goods to the poore, yea, euen the giuing of their bodies to fire, but becauſe they haue no loue, they are as ſounding braſſe and tinkling cimbals, they are nothing.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18664:65"/> It is not therefore by theſe my benefits,<note place="margin">Auguſtine in praiſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</note> which euen they that are not my Diſciples may alſo haue, that men ſhall know you to be my Diſciples: but onely in this, that ye loue one another: Likewiſe a man may receiue the ſacraments, and yet be wicked, but no man can haue loue and be wicked. Not without reaſon therefore doth Saint Paul, writing to the Galathians, ſay. <hi>Neither circumciſion auaileth anything, neither vncircumciſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cal, 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>but faith which worketh by loue.</hi> In which ſentence the Apoſtle ſheweth, that in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt the matter wherein we doe moſt teſtifie our faith: which is of greateſt accompt: and whereto wee are eſpecially to apply and giue our ſelues, is loue,<note place="margin">Auguſtine in praiſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> which alſo Saint Auguſtine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the fountaine of all goodneſſe, as couetouſneſſe is the roote of all euill.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That this loue may be pure and true,<note place="margin">Auguſtine in his confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Proſper in his ſentences of Auguſtine,</note> it muſt ſo proceed from our loue of God, that we may loue our neighbour in reſpect of that loue which we beare to God. For as Saint Auguſtine ſaith, we loue not God ſo much as we ſhould, if we loue any thing but him, which we loue not for the loue of him, and therefore in another place he ſaith. Bleſſed is he that loueth God, and his friend in God, and his enemie for the loue of God. Hereby are we to gather three points: Firſt, that albeit ſome heathen may ſeeme to haue done workes of great charitie and loue, yet was the ſame no true or liuely charitie, which is proper and peculier to the children of God: for they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe know and loue God, and their neighbours for Gods ſake. And indeed loue ought to proceed from a pure hart, as both Paul and Peter doth teach. <hi>By faith our harts are purified.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.5. 1. Pet. 1.22. Act. 15.9.</note> None there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but the faithfull haue true loue which proceedeth not from the loue of themſelues, but from their loue to God. Secondly, it appeareth in this, that in vaine we boaſt that we loue God, if wee loue not our neighbour for his ſake. This is it that Saint Iohn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, ſaying. <hi>If any man ſay, I loue God, and yet hate his brother, the ſame is a lier. For he that loueth not his brother whom he ſeeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.20. Rom, 13, 10,</note> 
                  <hi>how can he loue God whom he ſeeth not? And this commandement haue wee of him, that he which loueth God, loueth his brother alſo.</hi> Thirdly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we vnderſtand the truth of the ſaying of Saint Paul, that <hi>Loue is the fulfilling of the law.</hi> For if we cannot loue God, vnleſſe wee loue our neighbour, neither our neighbour, vnleſſe our loue to him proceed of our loue towards God: It muſt needes follow, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our neighbour, we alſo loue God, and ſo fulfill the law, which is comprehended in this: That wee loue both God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:18664:66"/>3 The better that we may yet vnderſtand what our loue ought to be, we are diligently to note the commandement of God, that we ſhould loue our neighbor as our ſelfe and explane this duty by two very naturall and iuſt rules which neceſſarily doe enſue. The firſt, by this auncient prouerbe, common euen among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.<note place="margin">Lampridius in the life of Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus.</note> 
                  <hi>Do no otherwiſe by another, then we would be done vnto.</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Seuerus, an Emperour endued with many excellent vertues, had this ſentence ordinarily in his mouth, thereby reprouing ſuch as wronged or iniuried others. Yea in publiſhing any ſentence of condemnation againſt tranſgreſſors, he cauſed the ſame to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the ground thereof. <hi>Doe no otherwiſe to another, then thou wouldest be done vnto.</hi> To be ſhort, he had ſuch a liking, and ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely embraced this ſentence, that he cauſed the ſame to be written and engrauen in his imperial pallace and in many publique works. The other rule reſteth in this, which Ieſus Chriſt commaundeth ſaying.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer yee would that men ſhould doe to you, euen ſo doe yee to them.</hi> Now the loue of our ſelues importeth, that men ſhoulde not only forbeare doing of vs hurt, but alſo that they ſhould do vs good. <hi>Draco, Licurgus, Solon</hi> and other lawgiuers haue written and ſet foorth many good lawes, whereby to maintaine man in equitie and vpright dealing: many Philoſophers haue written good bookes for the framing of the manners of men: Yet all their great volumes, their long diſcourſes, and the multitude of their lawes, haue alwaies had great imperfections, and tended as it were to the ordering but of the outward man, and ſo in parte to make men hypocrites, becauſe they could neuer attaine to the knowledge of true Chriſtian loue. But God in one onely ſhort ſentence, ſaying: <hi>Loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> hath comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole dutie of man, one towarde another, that they may liue together in al equitie: peace, loue and felicitie. And thus may theſe two naturall rules, <hi>Doe no otherwiſe to another then thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be doone vnto,</hi> and <hi>Doe as yee woulde be doone vnto,</hi> be ſufficient commentaries vpon all Chriſtian pollicie. In this ſence did Saint Paule iuſtly call this loue,<note place="margin">Col, 3.14.</note> the bond of all perfection. And indeed if we would loue one another as our ſelues and declare our loue by theſe two naturall rules, then ſhould there bee among vs, neither fraud, iniurie, wrong, nor deceitfull dealing. Then ſhould all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pride, couetouſneſſe, enuie, hatred, euill ſpeaking, and other like paſsions ceaſe. We ſhould ſee nothing but equitie, peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.4</note> loue reliefe and mutuall aſsiſtance. And theſe fruites of loue doth Saint Paul note ſaying. <hi>Loue ſuffereth long, it is bountifull, loue
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18664:66"/> enuieth not, loue doth not boaſt it ſelfe, it is not puffed vp: It diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, it ſeeketh not her owne thinges, it is not prouoked to anger, it thinketh none euill: It reioyceth not in iniquitie, but reioyceth in the truth: It ſuffereth all thinges, it beleeueth all thinges: It hopeth all thinges, it endureth all things.</hi> To be ſhort, if wee practiſe this loue, we ſhall euen in this life beginne to taſt the bleſſed eſtate of the kingdome of heauen, whereto being lifted vp, wee ſhall loue one another as our ſelues, and reioyce at our neighbours good, as at our owne. Let vs alwaies therefore remember this commaundement, that we loue our neighbour as our ſelues, and hartely let vs endeuour to ſhew it by the practiſe of theſe two rules, ſtill harkening to nature, who crieth ſaying. <hi>Doe no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to another then thou wouldeſt bee doone vnto:</hi> And <hi>Doe as thou wouldeſt be done by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 We are alſo farther to conſider,<note place="margin">1, Pet. 1.22. 1, Pet. 4 8.</note> that this loue muſt not bee colde, but ſeruent: not ſlacke, but earneſt and vehement, as Saint Peter admoniſheth vs. And that it may bee ſuch, it is requiſite firſt that we hold nothing ſo deare or ſo precious as to bee alwayes readie to employ our ſelues for our neighbour, yea euen to the ſpending of our liues,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.16</note> after the example of the loue that Ieſus Chriſt ſhewed vnto vs, as Saint Iohn ſayth: <hi>Hereby haue we knowen his loue, that he gaue his life for vs.</hi> So are wee alſo to giue our liues for our brethren. Secondly, the heate and ſeruencie of our loue and charitie ought to bee ſuch, as might ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mount any thinge that ſhoulde quaile it, as ingratitude, hatred, iniurie, or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieneſſe of our neighbours. And indeede if wee muſt loue our neighbour for the loue of God: If the Image God in him doth thereto binde vs. If being parcell of our fleſh wee ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to bee affected: then notwithſtanding whatſoeuer vnworthie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe bee in him, yet God muſt not looſe his right: his image is not vtterly defaced: Neither is that coniunction wherewith God bindeth vs together, taken away.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.29.</note> Therefore doth Ieſus Chriſt by the parable of the Samaritan teach vs, that euery one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, vnknowen, ſtraunger, yea euen an enemie, as were the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans to the Iewes, is our neighbour, whome wee muſt loue as our ſelues. And ſo did Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.43.</note> correcting the falſe gloſe of the Phariſies, expound it, ſaying. <hi>You haue heard that it hath beene ſaide. Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour and hate thine enemie: But</hi> I <hi>ſaye vnto you loue your enemies.</hi> And which is more, hee willeth that wee ſhoulde teſtifie this loue, not with our lippes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo in deedes and workes, by bleſsing thoſe that curſe vs,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18664:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> by doing well to thoſe that hate vs, and by praying for thoſe that moleſt and perſecute vs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23.4.5,</note>5 This did Moſes in his daies teach, ſaying, <hi>If thou meeteſt thy enemies Oxe or his Aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt bring him to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi> Againe. <hi>If thou ſee thy enemies Aſſe lying vnder his burden: leaue thy buſines that he may not riſe alone, yea leaue thy buſines &amp; help him vp.</hi>

                  </gap>d onely to our friendes, and that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not the ſame euen to our enemies, it is not the charitie of the children of God, but as Ieſus Chriſt addeth, of publicans and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Alſo in workes and deedes if we ſhew not the loue that wee beare to our enemies, it is in vaine for vs to proteſt that wee wiſh them no more hurt then to our ſelues, or that wee loue them, or wiſh as well to them as to our ſelues. The holy hiſtorie expreſſely noteth, that Abſalom vſed no hard words to his brother Ammon who had defouled Thamar the ſaid Abſalons ſiſter: Yet loued he him not, neither wiſhed his good, but in his hart nouriſhed cruell hatred againſt him, which hee finally declared by pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap>g him trayterouſly to bee murthered. And thus it appeareth, that ſpeaking neither well nor ill, betokeneth hatred and mallice. For loue can not but both ſpeake wel and do well euen to her enemies.</p>
               <p n="6">6 This loue is the rather to bee eſteemed and commended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the giftes of ſpeaking with tongues, working of miracles, prophecying, and ſuch like, are nothing without loue. Yea which is more then al thoſe gifts, euen faith &amp; hope ſhal haue an end, but loue, as Saint Paul ſaith, abideth for euer. Albeit therefore that by faith and hope we be made heires of wonderfull ioy and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet is the effect and fruite of loue greater, in this reſpect, that thereby the ioy of our perticuler felicitie, obtained by faith, ſhall be infinitly doubled and encreaſed for euery of the electes ſakes, whom we ſhall then loue as our ſelues, and whoſe felicitie will be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18664:67"/> vnto vs as great a comfort as our owne. Thus wee ſee what loue is required at our hands, and how much wee are to eſteeme it. Now if wee would examine our ſelues, and trie our loue with the ſame which God requireth at our hands, as is afore ſhewed, we ſhal find that it cometh very ſhort. And indeed what man loueth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelfe, and that for the loue of God? Who doth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times by his neighbour otherwiſe then himſelf would be done by? Who dealeth with another as he would be delt by? Who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to giue his life for his brethren? Who loueth his enemies as himſelfe, and in hart praieth for them? If loue, as is aforeſaid, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth long: if it enuieth not: if it ſeeketh not her owne: if it thinketh none euil: if the patience therof be ſuch as that it endureth &amp; ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth al things:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13</note> Then doth it ſufficiently appeare that we do wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully boaſt our ſelues to be the children of God, becauſe his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter cannot bee ſeene in vs, which is loue: or that in purpoſe to amend, we doe not miſlike our owne corruption. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heare the holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>Amend your liues.</hi> Let vs be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he doth admoniſh vs ſo to encreaſe in this loue, that wee may loue God with all our harts, and our neighbours as our ſelues: and that to the ſame end theſe two naturall rules may continually ſound in our eares: and that our conſciences by the ſame exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all our wordes and workes, may bee our iudge to condemne whatſoeuer we ſhall peraduenture doe to others which we would not ſhould be done to our ſelues, and to reproue our want of loue, when we do not that to him that we would haue done to our ſelues that ſo in amending whatſoeuer it ſhall find in vs not conformable to this loue, we may dayly encreaſe therin, and thereby more and more get printed in vs the Character of Gods children and of the true Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt. And now let vs proceed to another examination of our loue.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18664:68"/> indeed and in truth.</hi> This dutie of loue did the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt ſo hartely commend, that finding themſelues to agree in the doctrine of the Goſpell with S.

After whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we likewiſe ought in our ſelues to feele the neceſsitie &amp; want of our neighbours, becauſe they be our fleſh, and members of the ſame body, and ſo to apprehend their paine, anguiſh and ſorrow, as thereby to be moued with compaſsion towards them,</p>
               <p n="3">3 In as much therefore as in the conſideration of a woefull eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, the apprehenſion that we take by the eare, can neuer ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly moue the hart, as that which commeth by the eye,<note place="margin">Cicero,</note> ſaith an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Orator, euerie man ought diligently to viſite the poore in their tribulations: to the end that with their eyes beholding thoſe that lye vpon the ſtraw, that are ſicke, that are naked, that quake for colde, that want bread, that mourne for the lamentation of their poore children that crie for hunger, that are lodged in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where wee would ſcarce lay our dogges: this ſpectakle might moue the bowels of their harts to take compaſsion of their pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

In olde time God commanded his people to offer vnto him all the firſt fruits of ſuch goodes as grew to them from the earth: Moreouer the firſt loaues of the firſt dowe of the new corne: alſo the firſt licour preſſed either out of the oliue or out of the grape. And this was an acknowledgement that the land that they poſſeſſed was the Lordes, and an homadge teſtifieng that all the goods that they enioyed, proceeded from his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. In conſideration therefore, ſaith Dauid, that our wealth commeth not to his hands, he at this day ſubſtituteth the poore in his place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.2</note> as hee alſo addeth ſaying. <hi>But vnto the Saints that are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, am I wholy enclined.</hi> And therefore whenſoeuer the poore, or the deacons in their name doe come vnto vs, wee are to take them to bee Gods receiuers, that come to chalenge his right

               <p n="5">5 The tenne commandements of the law of God doe vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly comprehend the whole duty of man to God &amp; to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and thereof it followeth that the reliefe of the poore and all other the works of charitie are therein compriſed &amp; commanded. But in which commandement of the law? In the ſixt: <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> What is the ground and reaſon of this commandement?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by this word, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kil:</hi> It neceſſarily enſueth that he which relieueth not the poore at their need, is a murderer. And in deed, as we quench a lampe, not only by blowing it out, but alſo by keeping awaie the oyle that ſhoulde ſeed it: or as wee quench fire, not onely by caſting on of water, but alſo by keeping awaie woode from it: And in a great drought as many hearbes doo die, not onely by plucking vp, but alſo for want of watering: ſo is mannes lyfe taken awaie not onely by ſwoord or violence, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by not miniſtering vnto his neceſsities. And therefore Saint Ambroſe ſayth, Hee that refuſeth the poore in theyr neceſsitie,<note place="margin">Ambroſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pſalm Beati imacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati. Luk. 6.9.</note> killeth them. Let vs therefore, as hee addeth, beware wee burie not their liues in our coffers. Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe confirmeth the premiſes. For when vppon the ſabbaoth daie hee purpoſed to heale the man that had the withered hand, hee asked of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies that were offended thereat, whether it were lawfull vppon the ſabbaoth daie to do good, or to hurt: to ſaue, or to kill: thereby ſhewing, that the deferring of the cure of the poore man, was an euyll deede, yea euen murder. Moreouer, God forbiddeth to ſteale, but when wee giue to the poore, wee giue nothing of our owne, onely we diſtribute to them that which is theyrs, yea, which it were the euerie to keepe from them. It is the hungrie mannes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18664:70"/> bread, ſaith Saint Ambroſe, that thou keepeſt locked vp, and the naked mans garment that thou reſerueſt. If thou canſt helpe him, thou takeſt from him whatſoeuer thou denieſt him in his neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And indeede, euery man muſt thinke that he is not maſter and Lord, but onely ſteward of thoſe goods that God hath put into his hands. And therefore as a receiuer, a treaſurer or a ſteward, if he keepe backe that which he is commanded to furniſh or deliuer forth, is an vnfaithfull ſeruant and a theefe, euen ſo are we ſo long as we retaine that wherewith we ſhould relieue the poore in their neceſsitie. And as the Moone receiuing her light from the ſunne doth impart it vnto men, ſo are men to impart vnto the poore of the goods which they haue receiued from the Lord. Thinke not therefore that the reliefe of the poore is left at our choiſe: for it is Gods commandement as is before declared, and ſo it is diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ingratitude, vnrighteouſneſſe, ſinne, yea euen murder and ſacriledge in the ſight of God, becauſe we relieue not their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities according to ſuch ability as we haue receiued from the Lord: And albeit ſuch murder and ſacriledge paſſeth vntouched by the ſworde of the magiſtrate, yet in the preſence of God it is worthie of death and euerlaſting damnation.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Which is more through this neglect and contempt of the poor, we doe ſo much as in vs lieth, ouerthrow Gods prouidence. For in as much as he is our creator, it is alſo his part to feede and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs: and hee therefore ſo far honoreth ſome, as to giue them more plenty of goods then to other ſom: Yet not that they ſhould riotouſly waſt them, but rather to lay them vp, that they may bee his miniſters,<note place="margin">2.

Hom. 1.</note> But contrariwiſe when wee doe relieue the neceſsitie of the poore, our charitie, ſaith Saint Paule, cauſeth them to praiſe God, by acknowledging his care of them, in that hee giueth to men both charitie, and meanes whereby to releeue their neceſsitie. God by this his prouidence, ſayth Saint Baſill, hath ordained for man two crownes, for the poore, the crowne of pacience, and for the rich, the crowne of liberalitie: And as the poore doe depriue themſelues of their crowne by impaciencie and murmuring: ſo ought the rich by helping the poore, to ſtriue to obtaine the crowne of liberalitie. And to this purpoſe, they are to remember this ſentence pronounced by Ieſus Chriſt, as Saint
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18664:70"/> Paule ſaith, <hi>It is a more bleſſed thinge to giue then to take.</hi> Becauſe he that taketh, receiueth onelie corporall aſsiſtaunce: But hee that giueth,<note place="margin">Act. 20, 35.</note> beſides the commoditie of meanes whereby to helpe himſelfe and the honour to bee a ſtewarde of Gods goods, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo purchaſeth a crowne &amp; a permanent treaſure in life euerlaſting. And this is one pointe which ſhoulde alſo kindle vs in the dutye of charitie.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Moſt men doe imagine, that all that they giue to the poore, is ſo much diminution of their owne goodes and loſſe to them, yea euen as money caſt into the ſea, And this theyr falſe opinion groweth heereof, that in their conceite they reape no profite thereof in this lyfe: becauſe they doe not apprehend the rewarde promiſed in life euerlaſting: But theſe men ſhoulde firſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the prouerbe: hee that payeth, empoueriſheth not.

Moreouer, by this miſtaking, they aboliſh faith which aſſureth vs, not of things that wee ſee with our eyes, but of thinges inuiſible, neither of that which is preſent, but of that that is to come. As therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is the foundation of faith, ſo are wee carefull to meditate thereupon, that wee may aſſure our ſelues that our charitie hath great reward in the ſight of God, and ſo be ſtirred vp therto. Firſt it is one thinge to bee noted, as is aforeſaide,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> that the ſentence which Ieſus Chriſt ſhall pronounce in the daie of iudgement, ſhall be grounded vpon the helpe and reliefe, or neglect and contempt of the poore: as alſo that the Sonne of God ſhall call and bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſſeſsion of the inheritance of his euerlaſting kingdome, all thoſe that ſhall haue miniſtred foode or apparell vnto the poore, that ſhall haue viſited the ſicke, or in generall haue relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thoſe that haue beene in affliction: and contrariwiſe ſhall ſend all ſuch as haue beene negligent and ſlacke in theſe workes of charitie, into euerlaſting fire with the deuill and his Angels. And as hee ſhall call the one ſorte the bleſſed of God his father, and the other the curſed, ſo ſhall the ſentence bee imediatelie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, as the holy Euangeliſt Saint Mathew reporteth, and ſuch as haue beene mercyfull ſhall enter into euerlaſting lyfe, and the others into euerlaſting tormentes of hell fire prepared for the deuill and his Angels. This ſentence ſhould continually ring in our eares: not that wee ſhoulde thinke our ſelues able through
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18664:71"/> theſe works of charitie to merite this euerlaſting kingdome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it is called an inheritance, and hath beene prepared for vs, as Ieſus Chriſt himſelf ſaith, from before the foundations of the world: alſo that hee purchaſed it for vs by dying for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: and hereof he aſſureth vs by the teſtimonie of the holy Ghoſt ingendering faith in vs, but becauſe theſe workes of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are the true fruites, effectes, and markes of our faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of our election and adoption: and the way whereby he willeth vs to walke toward the poſſeſsion of his euerlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. To the end alſo that wee ſhould not doubt of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of this ſentence, Ieſus Chriſt aduoweth whatſoeuer our doings to the poore, whether to their reliefe or to their contempt, to bee doone to his owne perſon. Yea I ſay hee will make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of it and rewarde it, as if it were done to himſelfe. Were it not our dutie therefore to abhorre all contempt of the poore? For who would not thinke him either mad or deſperate that ſhoulde denie Ieſus Chriſt of meate and drinke in his hunger or thirſt, or cloth in his nakedneſſe, or harborrow in his neceſsitie?

Who woulde not thinke it a great bleſsing to lodge him in his houſe, and by diſplacing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to lend him his bed?

               <p>ALreadie haue we ſpoken of Charitie, and Almes proceeding therefrom. To this vertue there is nothing more oppoſite than couetouſnes, whereof we will now intreate. And that we may the better vnderſtand what this vice is, wee are to note, that the worde <hi>Auarice,</hi> ſignifyeth couetouſnes. The Grecians tearme it ſometimes, Deſire of Siluer, ſometimes, Deſire to haue more. And in deed, as it is hard for a man that loueth ſiluer, to moderate his couetous affections and deſires, ſo by experience we perceiue, that the man that loueth money, and longeth to haue more, that is to ſaie, the couetous man, is vnſatiable in his affection, alwaies hungring, ſtill out of taſt, euermore burning in a feruent deſire to increaſe that which hee hath. That which hee hath, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth nothing, and ſtyll aſpireth to that hee hath not. And as that which hee hath not, is among men infinite, ſo is mannes appetite neuer ſatiſfied. When our children aske more to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt than wee thinke meete, wee chide them, and ſaie, Better fill theyr bellies than theyr eyes, or at the leaſt if wee fill both theyr handes, they depart contented, and wyll not peraduenture craue theyr breakfaſts agayne in three or foure dayes: but the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, whoſe eyes of couetouſneſſe are greater than his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and whoſe deſire exceedeth his neceſsitie, is not content wyth his handes full, and inough for many dayes and yeeres: but coueteth after all that is in the worlde, yea, if hee myght poſsiblie haue it all, yet woulde hee not bee ſatiſfied. Saint Auguſtine compareth a couetous man vnto a ſepulchre, which neuer cryeth,<note place="margin">Auguſtine to Iulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ep. 111</note> Inough: yet is there ſome difference betweene them, for the ſepulchre, ſayth he, conſumeth all that it receiueth,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18664:81"/> but the couetous man, neuer employing that which hee hath, will not neuertheleſſe crie enough. Hee is neuer ſatisfied with ſiluer,<note place="margin">Eccle, 59.</note> ſaith Salomon, hee imagineth that hee wanteth all that other men haue. Bruite beaſtes, ſaith Saint Auguſtine, euen the greateſt raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are ſometimes ſatisfied: neither hunt they after their pray or giue themſelues to rauine, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they hunger: but both the hart &amp; hand of the couetous man are ſtill ſtretched forth to robbe and reaue. Epicurus ſaid, that nothing could ſuffice the couetous man:<note place="margin">Auguſtine vpon the words of the Lord.</note> Purſes &amp; coffers may wel be filled but couetouſnes hath no more bottome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bottomles pit. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour Lacinius had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed all with golde and ſiluer, yet did he euen with ſighs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile his pouertie. And indeede couetouſneſſe neuer regardeth that it hath, to be therewith content, but what it hath not,<note place="margin">Euſeb. in his firſt booke of Conſtantine in is his Eccl. Hiſtorie.</note> to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet there after. It reſembleth a riuer whoſe ſpring is ſmall, yet by receiuing other brookes and ſtreames groweth ſtrong and violent. The couetous man reſembleth them that are ſicke of the dropſie, who by drinking are neuer ſatisfied, but ſtill encreaſe in thirſt. His hart is like a flame which is neuer abated with quantitie of wood, how much ſo euer a man layeth on, well may it for a while be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and yeelde foorth nothing but ſmooke, the witneſſe of a hidden fire, but breaking out, it waxeth greater according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of woode.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In this reſpect the more the couetous man hath, the greater are his wiſhes. And indeede the wiſh of the Artificer is one, of the Marchant another, and of the King another. The Artificer, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to wealth, wiſheth ſome foure or fiue hundred Florens: the Marchaunt, eight or tenne thouſand, and the King, whole realmes to be adioyned to thoſe hee hath. Thus they that haue moſt,<note place="margin">Seneca in his booke of Moralities.</note> doe wiſh for moſt: Therefore ſaith Seneca, the poore man content, is richer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the richeſt couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the poor man deſireth litle, the rich man coueteth much. Thus may we vnderſtand this olde prouerbe, that the one halfe is more then all, becauſe the couetous man not contenting himſelfe with the one halfe, depriueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the enioying thereof, and encreaſing that which hee hath, encreaſeth his couetouſneſſe, which the more vehemently that it burneth in him, the more poore and needie doth it make him: For no encreaſe can ſatisfie that minde which wanteth contentment The more the Lacedemonians had, ſaith Iuſtin,<note place="margin">Iuſtine lib. 6.</note> the more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mans nature, did they couet, and therefore hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ioyned to their dominions the power of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they beganne to couet and affect the Empire and dominion

For there is nothing more ſenceleſſe then the leſſe way we haue to goe, the more to loade our ſelues with prouiſion, and as our way ſhortneth, ſo to encreaſe our burden. The ſhortnes of our life reproueth the large extent of our couetouſnes.

The getting of riches conſiſteth in great labour: the poſſeſsion and keeping of them in much care and feare: and the loſſe of them in extreame ſorrowe and heauineſſe.

This doth Saint Auguſtine note in this ſentence, Couetouſneſſe ſayth vnto man. Let me bee poſſeſſed of thee:<note place="margin">Auguſtine vp on the 125.

Ieſus Chriſt ſaying that the deceitefulneſſe of riches choaketh the good corne of Gods worde doeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare, that they reſemble a wanton ſtrumpet, ſuch a one as by her beautye cauſing manie men to luſt after her, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſuch as giue themſelues to enioye her, of all vertue, honour

                  <hi>that they bee not high minded, and that they trust not in vncertaine riches.</hi> Riches doe commonly breede pride, arrogancie, contempt of others, pleaſures, pompe, forgetfulneſſe of God, deſpiſing of eternall felicitie, peruers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,<note place="margin">Baſill in his Serm. againſt couetouſneſſe</note> and other like plagues. And this doth Baſill ſignifie, wher he ſaith, that the mad man deſireth nothing ſo much as to get wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reaſon of his exceſsiue diſtemperature: yet is ther nothing that ſo much tormenteth him: for the onely ſight thereof is able to caſt him into his fit, and to trouble him, and ſo it is with riches: Euerie man longeth for them, yet are they the onely things that encreaſe his longing, trouble his mind and repleniſh his hart with paſsions. When rich men, ſaith Socrates, will vſe their riches, they pollute them ſelues with pleaſures and pride: when they liſt to keepe them, care conſumeth them and eateth foorth their hearts when they labour to get them, they grow wicked and full of all miſerie. Chriſoſtome verie fitly compareth them to wilde beaſtes, whome a man can hardly take, and when he hath them, hee muſt take great care how to keepe them from doing hurt. And in truth as he that walketh in the raine ſhall hardly eſcape wetting, or hee that traueleth in the whote ſunne eſchew heate: ſo is it almoſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for a rich man to auoid vice and corruption by his riches.<note place="margin">Mark. 10.23,</note> And hereof ſpeaketh Ieſus Chriſt verie reſolutely, ſaying. <hi>How hardly doe they that haue riches enter into the kingdome God?</hi> True it is he afterwards expoundeth this ſpeach ſaying. <hi>Children how hard is it for them that truſt in riches to enter into the kingdome of God?</hi> But then adding that <hi>It is more eaſie for a Camell to paſſe through a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles eye then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God,</hi> Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth how hardly a rich man can eſcape confidence in his riches, and conſequently enter into the kingdome of God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 62.11.</note> And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect doth Dauid admoniſh vs when riches abound, not to ſet our

               <p n="11">11 Riches do not only engender a falſe confidence in the ſame, but become alſo a poyſon to humilitie, modeſtie, courteſie, and al other vertues, which it transformeth into pride and arrogancie, as the Apoſtle noteth in the place before aledged. Some haue written that Bucephalus the horſe of Alexander the great, ſo long as hee was naked, would ſuffer any man to backe him: but if hee were once furniſhed with the royall Sadle, Bridle, and other furniture, he grew ſo proud that no man might ride him but the king: euen ſo many who in their pouertie were modeſt, humble and vertuous, by encreaſe of wealth haue chaunged their vertues into vice.<note place="margin">Plut. in the life of Phocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Thus we ſee that there is no leſſe care and labour to beware that riches hurt not, then ſorrow and paine in getting them.

Alſo the vſe of ſiluer and golde, vſing no money but of yron, &amp; ſo did vtterly baniſh couetouſnes. And ſo long as they obſerued this diſcipline, they remained not only vertuous, but alſo inuincible to other nations: And contrariwiſe as ſoone as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking Licurgus lawes, they had opened a waie to wealth, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe crept in, who making them vicious, deliuered them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the power of their enemies.

Concerning the firſt, man is ſo vnthankfull to God, as if he giue him either knowledge, wealth, dignitie, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or anie other commendable or excellent gifte, hee attributeth the ſame to his owne induſtrie, &amp; in hew of giuing the glorie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to God, hee aſſumeth it to himſelfe, and waxeth proude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

               <p n="12">12 The third kinde of Ambition, is vaine boaſting or preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as when a man ſpeaketh or doeth anie thing, to the ende to ſeeme to haue more than hee hath, and to be that which he is not. Some there are ſo ambitious &amp; fooliſh in this point, that the leſſe they haue whereof to bragge, the more they boaſt themſelues, and ſo theyr bragges are as teſtimonies of theyr ignorance, want, and miſerie. When the ſhadowes of our bodies grow great, it is a ſigne that the Sunne beginneth to depart from vs: and in like manner it is an argument whereby to proue that vertue decaieth, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption augmenteth. As full veſſells make ſmall noiſe, &amp; when they yeeld a great ſound, it is a ſigne they be emptie: euen ſo vain glorie and much boaſt is a token of ſmall vertue. As alſo the poor pedlers that haue but theyr packs, doo in euerie market ſhewe all that they haue, when the great marchants doo make but ſome ſmal ſhew of the marchandiſe, whereof they haue great plentie: ſo doo theſe men by their boaſting declare themſelues to bee deuoyd of that whereof they ſet the greateſt face, and ſo depriue themſelues
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18664:93"/> of the glorie that they ſeeke for, and ſo it falleth out with them in manner as wee ordinaryly ſee, that the ſhadowe flyeth from thoſe that runne after it, and followeth thoſe that flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Alſo as the eares of corne that hang theyr heads, are ordinarily wel taken and full, and thoſe that ſtand vpright, do make vs to thinke that there is little in them: ſo they that walke in humilitie, and exalte not themſelues, neither ſeeke for glorie, are moſt endued with vertue, and other commendable qualities, when contrarywiſe, the greate boaſters by theyr proude ſpeeches, doo ſhew themſelues deuoyde of the ſame. Experience alſo teacheth, that as the vallies are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fruitfull, ſo the hills the higher they are, the more is theyr barrenneſſe. Let theſe men therefore no longer deceiue both the world and themſelues, neyther let them bee ſuch fooles, as to bee content wyth the falſe apparance and no effect: Let them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to bee in deede that which they would ſeeme to bee, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſe, holie, and vertuous, otherwiſe wee may liken them to ſuch as couet rather the name of a king, than the kingdome, or to bee king in deede. Withal, let them remember, that as ſuch impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and boaſting is intollerable among men, ſo when it is practiſed in matter concerning the ſeruice of God, it is no leſſe than deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hypocriſie in his ſight.</p>
               <p n="13">13 We haue alreadie declared, that ambition and deſire to bee mightie, together with ſuch arrogancie and pride as maketh man to glorie of himſelfe, to reioyce when glory is giuen vnto him, and to grieue when it is denied him, taken from him, or diminiſhed, are common faultes and deeply rooted in mens heartes, and wythall very dangerous: as alſo is boaſting, as when a man ſeeketh to ſeem to be more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is, or more than he hath. What more is ther now to bee done, but that as Ieſus Chriſt exhorteth vs to amend, ſo to the end to obey him, wee conſider vpon all conuenient meanes to correct and vtterly to mortifie this curſed ambition, pride, &amp; boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.<note place="margin">Plutarch of ſelfe praiſe.</note> Plutarch hath in writing left vnto vs many good rules and aduertiſements, to helpe vs herein. Firſt, he willeth vs to beware that wee take no occaſion to praiſe our ſelues, when we heare the commendations of others, eſpecially of our equals and inferiours, for then doth our ambition naturally deſire that they ſhoulde alſo ſpeak of vs. As when we ſee another feed ſauorly before vs, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our mouthes water to eate with him. Or, as experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when another man yauneth, we open our mouths &amp; yaun with him: but we are more inclined to praiſe our ſelues, when others do report our vertues &amp; commendable works, for therin are we tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18664:94"/> vntill we laugh again, and clawed where it doth itch. Likewiſe if the reporter thereof ſpeaketh ſoberly or with the leaſt, wee can not longer forbeare, but as if we meant to reueale ſome theft, and ſought to recouer the ſame, wee are ſtraight vrged to tell the reſt, yea, and rather than to looſe one iot of our commendation, more than all. Many times alſo it chanceth, that vnder pretence of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the vertues of another, we cunningly doo ſlip in, &amp; ſhew forth our own. As when a man exalting the humilitie and affabilitie of a king or prince, reporteth that he gaue him his hand, &amp; thus &amp; thus honoured him, pretending therby to let men vnderſtand, that him ſelfe is of good eſtimation and worthie honor. And herein do wee Chriſtians many times offend, when vnder colour of praiſing God for his gifts and graces poured vpon vs, wee rehearſe them to the end our ſelues may alſo haue ſome part of the glory. This is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſet glorie giuen to God, that our ſelues may haue a ſhare therin. Some there are that reproue others, and ſharply rebuke them of their faults and infirmities, propounding themſelues for examples of the contrarie vertues, and this is common with age, who therein ſeek to ſet a face vpon their owne glorie to the diſhonor of others. Others we ſhal alſo finde, who vnder pretence of humility do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſion of their own praiſe, &amp; ſo make their humility abait to catch their praiſe. They will abaſe their giftes, graces, vertues, and commendable actions in the preſence of ſuch as knowe them well inough, thereby to giue occaſion to gainſaie them, and ſo the more amplie to commend them, yea, they woulde bee loth a man ſhuld conſent to their own ſpeeches. Theſe aduertiſements might ſuffice to warne vs to beware of praiſing our ſelues. To conclude, we are to imagine, that as it is a griefe and trouble to vs to heare the boaſting and proud ſpeeches of others, ſo leaſt we ſhould giue like cauſe of trouble to others that heare vs, and withall incur the reputation of vaineglory, wee are to beware of praiſing our ſelues. Theſe be good aduertiſements deliuered by Plutarch. But in as much as they tend chiefly to frame a requiſite modeſtie and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe among men, that ſhunning the obloquy of ambition &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie, they may purchaſe the praiſe due to humilitie and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, wee wyll ſtand no longer vppon them, but proceede to the conſideration of ſuch things as may vtterly vncloath vs of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vainglorie, and boaſting in the ſight of God.</p>

Thou pleaſeſt all men, yet is there nothing more mightie in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or more grieuous in trouble: And truely if we could cut off theſe vices of ambition and pride, our mindes woulde ſure growe content and quiet: we ſhould not thus conſume in enuie, care, and a number of other paſsions which trouble and moleſt our minds: we ſhould not ſel our liberty, &amp; become ſlaues vpon an vncertain hope of dominion, neither ingage our conſciences to the deuill for kingdomes.

Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, as S.

And therefore Chriſoſtome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to a worme that breedeth in the wood, &amp; eateth it: alſo to ruſt, which growing out of yron, conſumeth it. Whereupon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that vainglory &amp; arrogancy are full of thorns that choak vp vertue: &amp; a beaſt that hath many armed heads, againſt thoſe that are poſſeſſed of him. Many are of opinion, that yong vipers do kil their dams in their birth, &amp; ſuch is our corruption, that it cauſeth pride to ſpring out of vertue, &amp; withal, this wicked child to be the deuourer of his dam. We are therfore ſo to reſiſt other corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,

               <p n="10">10 To theſe purpoſes, we muſt imagine that there is nothing leſſe conuenient to man than ambition, pride, and arrogancie. Let man, (ſaith Saint Auguſtine) for whom the ſonne of God humbled and abaſed himſelfe,<note place="margin">Auguſt. vpon the 18. pſalme</note> be aſhamed to ſtriue to be mightie and high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Seeing that man ſeeking to bee higher than hee was, is fallen from the height where hee was placed, reaſon requireth, that now he humble and abaſe himſelfe, contenting himſelfe to bee lowe in his owne ſight, that hee may recouer his loſſe, and bee mightie in him that humbled himſelfe for him.<note place="margin">Eſay 24.23</note>

The more directlie that the Sunne lieth vpon vs, the leſſe is the ſhadow of our bodie, as at noone wee may ſee by experience, and a little before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: euen ſo the leſſe that wee arrogate and boaſt of our ſelues, the greater giftes and graces of God are wee endued withall.<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="19">19 Let vs therefore renounce all ambition, mortifie all pride, &amp; deſpiſe the ſmoake of worldly glorie.

               </head>
               <p>AMbition and deſire of vainglorie, before mentioned, among other things, appeareth as well in the ſumptuouſneſſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell and ornamentes of the body, as in ſuperfluitie and exceſſe in diet. As concerning ſumptuouſneſſe in apparel and pompe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man in his owne heart muſt confeſſe, that that corruption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of a fooliſhe deſire of reputation among men. And in deede among the reſt, there bee three thinges greatly eſteemed in the worlde, and therefore yeelde ſome reputation vnto thoſe that haue them, Nobilitie, Riches: and in women and maidens, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This doo wee ſee to be ſo, in that men in marriage haue eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard to the ſame. In Nobilitie there is great reſpect of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement, and ſeldome ſhall yee finde marriage contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene gentry and yeomandrie. And as for Riches it is commonly the firſt queſtion, men do firſt enquire after it. And as an ancient Poet ſayde, Riches is the Queene and Ladie that giueth Nobility and Beautie. As for Beautie, <hi>When the ſonnes of God</hi> (ſaith Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) <hi>ſawe that the daughters of men were faire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.2</note> they toke them wiues from among them. Sith then that in marriage worldly men haue eſpeciall regard to Nobilitie, Riches, and Beautie, we may thereby perceiue what is of moſt eſtimation in the world. And this is the cauſe why euerie man deſireth to bee thought rich and noble. But as for women, that which they doo greatlyeſt account of, is either to be, or at the leaſt to ſeeme faire, as therefore ornamentes and ſumptuouſneſſe in apparell, doo ſerue to increaſe the apparance &amp; reputation of Beautie, Riches, and Nobilitie: ſo is it the principall cauſe why euerie one declineth to this corruption. And in deede we ſhal finde few in whom ambition and deſire to be thought rich or noble, and among women beautifull, is not the verie fountaine and ſeed of gorgeous attire, and exceſsiue ornaments of the body. This is it that maketh the artificer to apparell himſelfe as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the marchant as the gentleman, and the gentleman as the prince. To be ſhort, euery man enhaunceth his eſtate, yea, &amp; exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that hee maye ſurmount other of his calling. Such is our curioſitye and ſumptuouſneſſe heerein, that in all thinges there muſt bee exceſſe, either in the price of ſtuffe, as ſeeking and wearing the fineſt, &amp; conſequently, the deareſt, either in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie thereof, as wearing ſilke in ſtead of wooll, either in the gards,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18664:97"/> as wearing them broade, or four or fiue double: either in the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euer new fangled, and full of ſuperfluitie and vanitie: as in the ruffs, in the attires for the head, or in other inuentions of the world or the fleſh: and of theſe is the minde, eſpecially of women, ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they doo manifeſtly declare that theyr whole ſtudie and care, for the moſt parte, tendeth to the decking vp and attiring of themſelues.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neither is this any new diſeaſe, for we ſee in the dayes of Eſay, how the Iewiſh women were addicted thereunto, who ware orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſlippers,<note place="margin">Eſay 3.18</note> or bells, cals, and round tires, ſweet bals, brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and bonnets, tires of the head, and the ſloppes, and the head-bandes, tablets, eare-rings, rings, &amp; mufflers, coſtly apparel, vailes, wimples, and criſping pinnes, glaſſes, and fine linnen, hoodes, and lawnes, girdles, dreſsing of the haire, ſtomachers, claſpes, rocquets, purſes, garters, ribandes, chaines, &amp;c. And verie lyke it is that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie heere ſpeaketh of women, maidens, and Ladies of the court: For ſome in deede doo thinke that he was vnkle to Manaſſes, the king of Iuda. And is there not at this daie as great ſuperfluitie and vanitie in women and maidens of the like calling? Nay, ſhall wee not finde ſome meane Gentlewomen, yea, euen marchants wiues, that will imitate the ſame? As by experience wee ſee them laden with thoſe, and other like vanities and new inuentions. And as theyr hearts are wholy ſet vpon the world and the fleſh, ſo is there no ende of theyr luſtes and deuiſes. And this doeth Eſaie verie fitly ſhew by ſuch a long beadroule of trinkets and vaine inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the women and maides of his time, for euen the skilfulleſt Taylers that of late dayes were able to haue ſatiſfied the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Ladyes of the Court, woulde now bee ſcarce good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſes, and the skilfulleſt that nowe are, haue much a doe to content the curioſitie of Gentlewomen, yea, euen of ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes wiues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Howbeit (a litle by the way to touch this corruption) In ſome this exceſſe hath yet farther ſcope: for not contenting themſelues with that naturall colour which God hath beſtowed vppon them, eyther with the vſe of common water for cleanlyneſſe, they daily imploie their waters wherewyth to make them ſeeme fairer than they are, yea, which is worſe, ſome doo euen paint themſelues, daubing theyr faces and laying on ſome colour, wherewyth, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the handie worke of God, they maye ſeeme to haue more beautie than hee hath vouchſafed to giue vnto them. This vanitie was in vſe in the dayes of wicked Iezabel, and hath euer
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18664:97"/> ſince ſucceſsiuely continued in many others that haue, and doe imitate this accurſed woman, deuoured by dogges, together with her painting:<note place="margin">2. King. 9.30. Auguſtine in his Epiſtle to Poſsidonius. Tertullian of womans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. Cyprian in his 5. Sermon of the fall, and in his booke of virgins appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. Chriſoſtome hom. 31 vpon Mathew. Ierom againſt Heluidius. Ierome to laeta of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of maidens. Ierome in his Epiſtle to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note> This corruption hath likewiſe beene euermore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the holy fathers. Saint Auguſtine hath written one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe treatiſe thereof, wherein hee at large condemneth all ſuch paintings. Tertullian proteſting that God neuer created man ſo patcht or painted, demandeth whether in their reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead their colours wil hold: and ſeeing it is vnlike they ſhould, he exhorteth them to deſiſt therfro, as from things repugnant to their creation, and reſurrection, and termeth ſuch as paint themſelues, the deuils handmaides. Cyprian by this ſimilitude confirmeth the premiſes. If when a painter hath finiſhed a peece of worke, and an other comming in ſhould thereto ſet his hand and lay on other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, it would diſpleaſe him: how much rather will our creator be offended, when a mortall man whom himſelfe hath created, ſhall by ſuch painting take vpon him to correct the image and worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his God? Chriſoſtome reſembleth ſuch as paint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to thoſe that daube clay or mire vpon an Image of golde. And as Ierome termeth it, what is it but a reproch to his creator, who as hee imagineth, hath not made him faire enough? And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in another place reported the hiſtorie of a woman viſited by the hand of God for painting her daughter, he addeth that they that vſe it doe pollute the temple of God, and termeth their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, firebrands to enflame youth: nurſes of fornication and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of vnpure harts.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But to returne to the corruption in pompous and ſumptuous apparell. Euerie man can confeſſe that this exceſſe is ouer plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and common among vs. They can ſpeake of it: They can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of it: they can ſay, there is no amendement in vs: but euery one doth giue occaſion of offence. They can grant that we deſerue ſtripes: that God will puniſh vs, and that iuſtly: and all theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be euen ſo many iudgements regiſtred in heauen, which in the end we ſhall find to be but an execution againſt vs, becauſe no man amendeth, but euery one looketh who ſhall firſt beginne. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man imagineth that himſelfe may well weare ſuch apparell, and that he may better doe it then another of his like calling. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man condemneth exceſſe and vanitie, yet wil he therby declare himſelfe to be more rich then an other, allowing that in himſelfe, which he reproueth in others. Wee confeſſe the obiections made vnto ſuch as flee from their owne habitations for religion to bee moſt true: namely, that they bring their pompe and ſumpteous
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18664:98"/> apparell with them, into the townes that receiue them, thereby alluring the naturall inhabitants, who before liued in greater ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and modeſtie, to the like vanitie and corruption. To bee ſhort, it ſeemeth that we who vnto others ſhould be as lampes and miniſters of reformation, are growen to be auctors of infection &amp; offence. And this may be but too truely obiected, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our great confuſion, and to the ſlaunder of the doctrine which we doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. Remembring therefore the exhortations of Chriſt and Saint Iohn, importing that we ſhould Amend our liues, let vs laſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to leaue off, forſake and deteſt all this exceſſe, vanity, pompe and ſumptuouſneſſe in apparell.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But truely neither the Cenſors of Rome, who made ſo manie good lawes concerning this matter: neither the wiſeſt reformers of our time could euer ſo bridle this ambition and exceſſe: but that as an cele it would ſlide forth and ſhew it ſelfe transformed into ſome new faſhion. To be ſhort, there is not any lawgiuer that can ſound the depth of this corruption, but onely one God, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to beginne reformation at the hart. And indeed as euery ſeede bringeth forth hearbes or fruite according to his kind as Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſeede, Lettice, Thiſtle ſeede, Thiſtles, ſo if the hart be humble and modeſt, the garment for the bodye will bee euen ſo: but if the heart bee proude and ambitious, it will ſhew foorth ſome kinde of exceſſe and pride, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer lawes to the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>6 The firſt thing thereof that the Chriſtian which mindeth to roote out pompe and exceſſe in apparell, is to note, is as well the qualitie of the garments that God made for Adam and Eue after their fall: as the occaſion of the ſame. Their firſt garmentes were of the skinnes of beaſtes, thereby to declare that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as beaſtes, by tranſgreſsing the commaundement of God. The occaſion of the garmentes was ſhame to ſee themſelues na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whereinto they ſell by tranſgreſsing the ſaide commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. The firſt vſe of the garmentes therefore is vnto vs an euident reproch of their ſinne, to the end to humble vs in the ſight of God: as when a man weareth a plaiſter, it is a ſigne hee hath ſome wounde. And therefore ſuch as ſeeke glorie in garmentes, are like vnto thoſe that builde faire ſepulchers for their dead corps: For where as their ſepulcher ſhoulde bee a warning to them that they muſt dye, and thereupon cauſe them to reiect all ambition and pride, yet thereof they take occaſion to boaſt: ſo where as our garment ſhoulde bee a continuall memorie
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18664:98"/> of ſinne, to humble vs, yet wee, as if wee woulde euen ſpite God, doe procure ſumptuous and gorgeous apparell to teſtifie our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and pride. As a theefe by law burned in the foreheade for theft, ought ſo oft as he looketh in a glaſſe and perceiueth the ſcarre thereof, to thinke vpon and deteſt his inclination to that vice: ſo our garmentes being as the ſcarre in the foreheade of our firſt fathers and our ſelues for their ambition: in that they ſought to bee like vnto God, ſhould by the onely ſight of them, put vs in minde to renounce all pride and ambition. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore couer our bodies decently to hide our ſhame, and not proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to augment it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The ſecond vſe of garmentes is to defend vs from colde, from raine, from the heate of the ſunne &amp;c. What argument can we gather hereof to grow proud? Hereby we ought to cal to mind Gods wrath againſt ſinne, conſidering that had it not beene for ſinne, man ſhoulde neuer haue beene annoyed with heate or colde that doe ſo moleſt him. Moreouer this vſe of garmentes doeth teſtifie vnto vs. Gods goodneſſe and mercie towardes vs, in that hee miniſtreth wherewith to releeue our neceſsities, and ſo bindeth vs more and more to praiſe him. To make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our garmentes a pompe, and ſhew whereby to bee hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and glorified, is the reuerſing of the vſe of them, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſacriledge againſt God. Yet is this corruption ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that there is none, no not the little children, but will boaſt of gay garments. Let vs therefore that haue more wit then children, euen vs, I ſay eſpecially that are inſtructed in Gods word, and know the originall and vſe of garmentes: in liew of ſeeking glorie in the ſame, learne by them to humble our ſelues, and to render all thankes and prayſes to God to whome it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth.</p>
               <p n="8">8 For a third remedie, let vs remember what a folly, yea what an extreame iniquitie it is to take more care for garmentes for the bodie, then for ornaments for the ſoule. For as the bodie being of more valew then the garment, wee will ſell or pawne foorth the garment, for to feede the bodie: ſo ought wee to leaue all affecton to beautifie our bodies, the better to tende to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning of our ſoules. And hereto doth Saint Peter exhort vs,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 3.</note> ſaying. <hi>Let not the womans apparell be outward with broydered heare, or golde put about, or in putting on of apparell, but let the hid man of the hart be vncorrupt, with a meeke and quiet ſpirit, which is before God, a thing much ſet by.</hi> The ſame doth S. Paule alſo confirme, ſaying
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18664:99"/> 
                  <hi>Let women araie themſelues in comely apparell with ſhamefastneſſe and modeſtie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.9</note> 
                  <hi>not broidered haire, or golde, or pearle, or coſtly apparell, but (as becommeth women that profeſse the feare of God) with good workes.</hi> If wee dwel in a borrowed houſe, looking weekly when we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, wee wyll neuer trouble our ſelues wyth anie coſt or fitting of it, as wee woulde doo, if wee were ſure to remayn in it all the daies of our liues. And what is the bodie but a houſe lent vnto the ſoule, from whence it looketh dayly to departe? What reaſon haue wee then ſo to care for adorning the bodie, which ſhortly muſt rot and periſh, &amp; ſo to neglect the ſoul which is immortal? Men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doo care to be more honeſtly appareled when they are to meet at ſome banquet, or marriage, or to come before ſome honourable perſonages, than ordinarily when they conuerſe wyth inferiours: Now wee, as concerning our bodies doo conuerſe wyth men lyke vnto our ſelues: but as concerning our ſoule, with God and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to whome it is lifted vp, now by faith, but at death really. Is it not therefore repugnant to all order and reaſon, to care more for the beautifying of the bodie, than for adorning of the ſoule?</p>
               <p n="9">9 Some man wyll ſaie, Why, albeit we beautifie our bodyes, yet doo wee thinke vpon the adorning of the ſoule. But this is a mere abuſe, for it is an olde ſaying, that the great care to prouide for the bodie, is an euident token of the neglect and ſmall affection to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the ſoule. Who can ſaie that hee is loth to burne his houſe, when hee layeth burning coales hard by a ſtacke of ſtrawe? Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wee are inclined to ambition and pride, and what is all this pompe &amp; prouiſion for the bodie, but wood and ſtraw kindled by the fyre of our Ambition? Humilitie, modeſtie, charitie, chaſtitie and holineſſe, are the chiefe ornamentes of our ſoules, and is there anie thing more contrarie to theſe vertues than Ambition, pride, crueltie, luſt, and prophane liuing, which all doo appeare in theſe pompes and ornamentes for the bodie? Well may wee confeſſe, that there bee ſome more proude in theyr paltrie peltes, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in theyr ſumptuous apparell. When Antiſthenes ware a turnde cloake, Socrates tolde him that hee diſcerned his vaineglorie and ambition through the rentes of his cloake. Contrariwiſe, queene Heſte rproteſted before God, that ſhee tooke no more pride in her moſt rich apparell,<note place="margin">The laſt book of Heſt. 14.6</note> than in baſe and defouled clothes. But we ſpeake of that which is common with men, as experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For in deede wee ſhall finde few in whome ambition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bee thought rich, or noble, or among women, to appeare fayre, is not the verie originall foutnaine of theyr ſumptuous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18664:99"/> pompe and beautifieng of the bodie.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Some will reply: did God create golde, ſiluer, ſilke and ſuch like, to no vſe? We confeſſe he created them to vſe, but not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe: of his liberalitie to take occaſion to praiſe him, but not to extoll our ſelues. And truely it is a great abuſing of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when we employ them to maintain our pride and ambition, and in liew of reſeruing al honour and praiſe to him that is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of them, to miniſter offence to our neighbours. Againe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that the vſe of ſilke and golde, permitted to Kinges, Princes, and people of like calling, ſhould equally bee permitted and commanded for euerye Marchaunt and Artificer. Princes may without reprehenſion or blemiſh of pride weare that which Marchaunts and Artificers cannot vſe without note of pride and preſumption. True it is, that the more modeſtly that any ſhall vſe it, the more commendable it is? But it were but a trouble to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and conſcience without reaſon or ground, to ſubmit all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whatſoeuer calling to Marchaunts attire: as alſo it is not conuenient to abaſe Marchaunts into poore Artificers apparell.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Yet is there another point to be conſidered. God (as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other purpoſe is afore ſaid) hath made men not Lordes, but ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of his goods, with condition that they ſhall giue accompt of the ſame. And in that reſpect it is lawfull for men of honour and calling, honourably to cloth themſelues, ſo long as they alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue meanes, and clothe the poore members of Chriſt.

The ſilke ribbands and lace that couer the cloth, the edgings, paſſements and purles added to ſtuffe of it ſelfe curious enough, the ringes enriched with precious ſtones, the golde, the ſiluer and pearle wherewith the bodies are decked vp, ſhal in the day of iudgement ariſe againſt thoſe that take no pitie of the poore that lay vpon ſtraw, went woolward and quaking for colde for want of garments: Let thoſe that diſpence with ſuch ſumpteouſnes and exceſſe, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their owne conſciences whether they doe to others as they would be doone to if God ſhould viſite them with the like neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.

Let them then thinke with themſelues whether in the accompt of the goods that God hath committed vnto them, the Articles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and ſuperfluitie in apparell will bee alowed by him who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly heareth the cries and oppoſitions of his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, complayning that they were left naked. If a Taylour when he hath made a garment a great deale too long &amp; large, being repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſhall haue no other excuſe but that hee had too much ſtuffe, woulde that bee accepted? Woulde they not tell him, that hee ſhoulde haue made the garment after the meaſure of the bodie, but not according to the quantitie of the ſtuffe? Euen ſo they that hauing plentie of goods doe employ them not after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their vocation, or the profeſsion of a reformed religion, but in ſuperfluitie and exceſſe, doe expoſe themſelues to the skorne and grieuous reprehenſion in the ſight of God, and his Angels. Let them therefore cloth themſelues decently, euerie man according to his calling, yet ſo that the poore bee not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in their neceſsities. Let them put on ſuch cloth that the poore may at leaſt haue freeze. To bee ſhort, let them put in practiſe the ſaying of Eſay of the conuerſion of the Marchaunts of Tyre,<note place="margin">Eſay. 23.18.</note>

Yet doth our dutie alſo require that for our partes wee ſhoulde take away all obiections or occaſion to ſtumble at vs. Alſo as they are not to condemne the doctrine for anie ſuch outward matters, ſo are wee to remember the proteſtation of Saint Paule, who ſayth,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>NOw let vs ſpeake of banquets. No man can in theſe daies make a feaſt without exceſſe, and that exceſſe muſt bee alſo reproued and repreſented to the hoſt by ſome one of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, euen of thoſe that profeſſe the religion: yet ordinarily in ſuch ſort, as the hoſt accompteth it as a commendation of his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence &amp; plentie. As alſo if he that ſemeth to find the fault, chance afterward to make another, it ſhal likewiſe be ſuch, as he likewiſe wil looke for the like cenſure, which hee alſo will take to redound to the praiſe of his liberalitie and plentie. Hereto haue relation all excuſes of meane entertainment, and deſire to take patience, euen in a feaſt that ſloweth with all dainties, and are motioned onely to miniſter occaſion to the gueſts to ſay that there is but ouer much, and by ſuch a cenſure to get the commendation of plentie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. Thus each man reprouing and accuſing other of exceſſe, no man ſheweth any Amendement. Yet let vs not thinke but theſe pettie cenſures, proceeding either of worldly ciuilitie and ſlatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or of Chriſtian admonition, are ſo many ſentences giuen by
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18664:101"/> our owne mouthes, which ſhall be laide before vs in the daie of iudgement to our condemnation. God hath ordained meate and drinke for two principall purpoſes. Firſt to nouriſh and relieue vs, to the end that thereby recouering new ſtrength and force (which fitly is called refection) wee may euery man applie our ſelues to that ſeruice whereto he hath called vs: But our banquets contrariwiſe doe returne vs vnprofitable, as growing ſo dull and heauie by our long ſittinges and plentie, that wee are fitter and more readie to ſleepe like hogges, then as Chriſtians prouided to follow our vocations: eſpecially to heere or reade Gods worde, or to tend to prayers and meditation. And thus in our banquete we take not our refection but deſtruction. If a horſe by eating too many Oates ſhould grow heauie and ſlacke to goe or drawe, wee woulde beware of giuing him too much, leaſt wee ſhoulde both looſe our prouender and weaken our horſe: Euen ſo in meate and drinke and long ſittinges, if the plentie make vs heauie and ſlow in our vocations, namely in the ſeruice of God, we haue iuſt cauſe to cut it off, and ſo to take away the abuſe which is eſpecially hurtfull and to be condemned.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If our ſtudies were as much applyed to make our feaſts, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſimple, as they are plentifull and delicious, both our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies would be better at eaſe, our ſoules more readie to their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and our ſelues better able to relieue the poore. And indeede euen in dutie we are bounde to leane more to ſobrietie then to ſuperfluitie and exceſſe: to vertue then to vice: and to remember the ſaying of Iuſtine to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Iuſtine lib. 20</note> Frugalitie is the mother and nurſe to all vertue. Yet doe our aboundaunce of dainties, our diuerſitie of meates, and our inuentions of new ſauces and wantonneſſe declare the contrarie: So that now it will aske more time to learne to be a good cooke to make the body ſicke, then to be a Doctor of Phyſicke to miniſter health. We reprooue ſuch women as to the end to ſeeme more beautifull and to allure mens fancies, doe paint themſelues: Yet wee commend ſuch cookes as can make diuerſitie of ſauces to prouoke appetite to meate. Do we feare eating too litle &amp; an appetite accompanied with health? There was neuer man that repented his being ſober, but many their eating and drinking too much. The beſt is therefore to vſe common and groſſe meate, for that is eaſieſt gotten, ſooneſt and with leaſt labour made readie, of loweſt price, nothing ſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſuch as wee eate not much off. The Romaines did eate

               <p n="3">3 The ſecond purpoſe and vſe of foode is, to procure vs to prayſe and glorifie God for his goodneſſe and liberalitie towards vs. And therefore Saint Paule ſaith. <hi>Whether wee eate, or wether we drinke,</hi>

Plutarck reporteth, that a certaine nation called Siborites,<note place="margin">Plu. in his banquets of the 7.

But it were fitter, ſaith he, when we are inuited to a banquet, in time to prepare to come prouided of ſpeech, and honeſt, profitable and conuenient communication. If this conſideration coulde take place in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſopher, what a ſhame is it for vs Chriſtians to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to companie and feaſtes vnprouided of ſuch holie and vertuous talke, as might tend to Gods glorie and the edefying of the aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? And indeede the ſauce of Chriſtian banquets ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of wiſe, vertuous and holie diſcourſes. But our want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the ſtarued affection of our hartes to vertue, doe cauſe vs to conſume our time at banquets either in vaine talke or in vrging our gueſts to eate and drinke. Xenophon and other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were of opinion, that it were good and profitable to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect &amp; note downe al table talke. If Chriſtians, yea euen our ſelues that profeſſe the reformed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Plut. in his Syme. lib. 1,</note> ſhold put this in practiſe, what ſhould we find in ſuch regiſters?

Chylon, one of the ſeuen Sages of Greece had ſuch a regard hereto that when he was inuited to any feaſt, he would neuer promiſe to come before he knew who ſhould be there. For, ſaid he, of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a man muſt light vpon ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie as in a ſhip, or in the wars: yet is it not the part of a wiſe man voluntarily at feaſtes to medle with any, whoſoeuer. In like maner we reade that Antigonus the ſonne of Demetrius, being inuited to a banquet, at the which hee knew there ſhould be ſome inſolent &amp; light women, asked the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Philoſopher Menedemus, who anſwered only that hee ſhold reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that he was a kings ſon: by that ſaying admoniſhing him to refraine and beware of all vnhoneſt companie &amp; occaſion of euill.

How much rather ought wee Chriſtians, whome God by ſo manie preceptes and decrees hath commaunded to keepe modeſtie and ſobrietie, conſtantly to reiect ſuch reproches of the world and the fleſh, and to bee content with the teſtimonie of our owne conſciences, that our modeſtie and ſobrietie proceedeth from the feare of God and a feeling of our owne duties, which bindeth vs to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his ordinances?

               </head>
               <p>THe vanitie and exceſſe in banquetes before reprooued, doeth heere miniſter occaſion to ſpeake of the luſtes and pleaſures of the fleſh: firſt in generall: Then perticulerlie in ſome kindes, as in drunkenneſſe, gluttonie, licorouſneſſe, and fornication. As concerning voluptuouſneſſe in generall, wee haue a number of ſayings euen of the heathen, whereby with common conſent of all the world, and in all ages, the ſame haue beene reproued, and condemne, as daungerous, pernitious and not beſeeming man. Architas the Tarentine ſayde,<note place="margin">Cicero in his booke of olde age.</note> there is no peſtilence more mortall then voluptuouſneſſe, adding, that thereof proceede all treaſons againſt the countrie, ſubuerſions of common wealthes, ſecrete communications with enemies, to be ſhort, that there is not any enterpriſe ſo wicked, but by volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe a man may bee wrought thereunto. And proceeding in his argument, by many reaſons he proueth that nothing is more repugnant to the excellencie of man, or more deteſtable and pernicious then the ſame: And concludeth that there can bee no fellowſhip betweene luſt and vertue, and therefore that in the kingdom of voluptuouſnes, vertue cannot ſubſiſt. He ſaith farther, that about the ſame time that Cayus Fabritius was ſent to King Pirrhus, hee heard that at Athens there was one that maintained,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18664:105"/> that euery thing that man doth, ought to haue relation to volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe, and that when two Romaine Lordes heard him talking thereof, they wiſhed that the Samnites and King Pirrhus (then their enemies) might be perſwaded to that doctrine, that ſo they might with greater facilitie be ouercome. The like did Antiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hearing one commaund pleaſures, alſo wiſh to his enemies: As alſo the like counſell did Cyrus follow and put in practiſe againſt the Lydians,<note place="margin">Iuſtine in his firſt booke,</note> whom he had ſubdued: for taking away their horſe and armour, hee commaunded them to follow theyr luſtes and pleaſures, to the ende that thereby looſing their accuſtomed valour and vertue, they might together therewith forget alſo all courage to rebell.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This voluptuouſneſſe engendereth ſo manie vices and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that ſuch as compare it to a dreame, the pleaſure whereof at a mans waking vaniſheth awaie, doe ſay ſomewhat, yet nothing to the purpoſe. The Emperour Adrian goeth a little farther, when he compareth it to pils outwardly fairely guilt and rouled in Sugar, but within full of bitterneſſe. Yet goeth he farther then they all, which ſayth that pleaſure and ſorrow are twinnes: For pleaſure is no ſooner hatched, but repentaunce is at hand, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her as it were by the head readie to ſupplant her. And thereupon ſome haue ſaide, that ſhee reſembleth a ſmile, which preſently is turned to ſorrow and teares. And indeede, pleaſure flyeth and ſlideth away, leauing rather cauſe of repentaunce, then occaſion of remembraunce. Other haue compared her to a painted ſepulcher, faire without, but within full of mortall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſtench. And Plato terming it a bayte for all miſchiefe, thereby ſufficiently ſheweth, that ſuch as giue themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are taken and killed, euen as the fiſh that taketh the hooke couered with the baite. Neither were they much miſtaken that compared it to venome or ſtrong poyſon tempered with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras or ſweete milke. And indeede this voluptuous pleaſure ſo poyſoneth man, that it depriueth him of the reaſon and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his ſoule, together with the helpe of his bodie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him vnworthie to bee reckoned among men. And in that reſpect, ſayth Cycero, hee that is giuen to luſt, iudgeth all thinges, not by reaſon but by his owne ſence, and ſo thinketh that to be the beſt, which moſt delighteth him, and ſo doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilye conſent to bee caryed awaie with pleaſures, which longe him more and more in calamitie. Neither can we follow pleaſure
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18664:105"/> vnleſſe wee renounce vertue, becauſe that pleaſure reſpecteth the particular, and vertue the good of the common. And therefore there is not ſo badde a Lord and maſter, as pleaſure and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, whoſe nature is to make a man readie to all miſchiefe, and ſlowe to anie goodneſſe. It weakneth the bodie, as Diogenes noted, when to one giuen to luſt and pleaſure, hee applyed this ſaying of Homer, <hi>Child, thy life is ſhort.</hi> The ſame Diogenes alſo acknowledging that which wee haue ſaide, namely, that it is a vice vnbeſeeming man, doth aptly declare his minde. For in that the Athenians were much addicted to luſt and pleaſure, and the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians to ſobrietie and temperancie, as himſelfe was trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Lacedemon to Athens, beeing demaunded whence hee came and whither hee woulde: hee anſwered, that he came from among men, but was going toward women. And the ſame doeth Iuſtine note in Sardanapalus, who, ſayd he,<note place="margin">Iuſtin is his firſt booke.</note> liued in pleaſures more ſit to bee a woman than a man, eſpecially one that raigned ouer ſo many prouinces. And in deed, that luſtfull lyfe was the worker of his death,<note place="margin">Cicer. li. 2. de finibus.</note> through the conſpiracie of ſome that could not lyke to bee gouerned by ſo voluptuous a king. And therefore dyd Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro iuſtly ſaie, that he that giueth himſelfe ouer to luſt but one day, is vnworthie the name of a man. And in deede, luſt is more ſit and conuenient for hogs, than for a man endued with reaſon and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To conclude, what greater iniurie can our enemie worke vs,<note place="margin">Sen. Epiſt. 28</note> ſayth Seneca, than theſe luſts doth vnto many? for plunging them ſelues therein, they get ſuch a cuſtome, that they become moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, in that they grow into neceſsitie of things before ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe they cannot bee without them, and ſo doo ſerue their luſts, which they cannot inioy, yea, which is the type of all calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they loue theyr owne miſhap. And this enemie is ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe wyth the outward face &amp; alluring baites thereof, it hath ouercome the ſtrongeſt and moſt valyant men in the world, as Hanibal, who after he had ouercommen his enimies, was conquered by luſt and pleaſure. It is a gulfe or fire that deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mans ſubſtance and wealth, wherwith he ſhould liue &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe and his familie: and (which is another miſerie) a path to all wicked practiſes, namely, to popular ſeditions, wherein men may fiſh in troubled water, and finde ſome pretence to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods, to proſecute theyr owne pleaſures. Pythagoras to that purpoſe ſayde, that pleaſure once entered into townes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered ſacietie, then violence, and laſtly deſtruction: and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarywiſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18664:106"/> that ſobrietie &amp; temperance are the two means to ſhun ſuch inconueniences. In lyke ſenſe the Philoſopher Heraclitus being required to ſhew the originall of ſedition, and how it might bee reſtrained, in ſtead of ſome long oration to the people, called for a little water and meale, &amp; tempering them together, he drunk it, and ſo without anie more ſpeeches departed, thereby declaring that continence and ſobrietie were the meanes to maintain peace and concord.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If the heathen, who had reſpect onely to man, and to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, could ſaie thus much a againſt luſt, how farre ought Gods children to deteſt it in reſpect of the life to come?<note place="margin">Auguſt in a certain Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> And in deed he, ſaith Saint Auguſtine, who for a ſmall pleaſure giueth that for the which Chriſt dyed, namely, his bodie and ſoule, ſheweth that hee eſteemeth Ieſus Chriſt to be but a fooliſh and vnwiſe marchant, that would redeeme with ſuch a price that which the voluptuous man eſteemeth ſo little of, and giueth ſo cheape, when he giueth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe to deſtruction for ſo ſmall a pleaſure, which wil ſoone be ouer. When luſts &amp; pleaſures, ſaith Saint Ambroſe, haue woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a man, they are gone, when they haue brought him into miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they are retired, and when they haue made him moſt wretched they haue forſaken him. Saint Barnard noteth three ſorts of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions in the Church: the firſt by tyrants: the ſeconde by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and the laſt by luſts and pleaſures, whereto hee addeth, that this laſt is the moſt pernitious, applying to that purpoſe this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which hee alleadgeth out of Eſaie, <hi>In my peace my bitternes is most bitter.</hi>

                  </gap>tter is the perſecution of tyrantes, more bitter of heretikes, but moſt bitter of all, is that of luſts and pleaſures. The ſame doth Chriſoſtome confirme, ſaying, We incur more harme by the pleſures of the fleſh, than by the moſt grieuous torments of tormentors, for torments do beget martyrs, but luſts do beget Epicures. Of torments we forme vertues, but of luſts we noriſh &amp; increaſe vice. And therfore we may compare our luſts to the apple which our firſt parents, tranſgreſsing Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did eat in paradiſe,<note place="margin">Gen 3.6 1.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Sith then that Ieſus Chriſt admoniſheth vs to amend, let vs take heed of ſo dangerous and pernitious an enemy, &amp; to that end, let vs remember all the ſentences before mentioned, by the which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that vnles he mind to be altogether mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wretched, he muſt ſhun ſuch luſts &amp; pleaſures. And by

To this purpoſe do we reade that Liſimachus, when the Scithians had beſieged him in a place, where for want of water he was forced to yeld, after he had dronke freſh water, ſaid, Alas, what a great felicitie haue I loſt for a very ſhort pleaſure? If a Painim would ſo grieue for looſing a temporall felicitie, howe much rather ought we that profeſſe to beleeue Gods word, &amp; by the teſtimonie of the ſame are to expect life and euerlaſting felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, both to think and ſay, when luſts do aſſalt vs, Alas, wretch that I am, ſhall I for inioying a briefe &amp; temporal pleaſure, looſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit and eternall felicitie?</p>
               <p n="6">6 Moreouer, let vs eſchue &amp; ſhunne al occaſions that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs hereunto, namely, ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie as is addicted to the ſame. For, as S. Augu. ſaith, his prouocations are leaſt,<note place="margin">Auguſt. of the ſingularitie of Cleargie.</note> that neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth among luſts &amp; pleſures: for as the man ſhal hardly ſcape free from blacking or meal that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſeth with millers or colliers, ſo ſhal he hardly eſcape pleſures that hanteth with thoſe that are giuen to follow their luſts and pleaſures. And as green wood laid vpon the fire, albeit at the firſt it reſiſteth, yet in the end doeth burne and is conſumed, ſo is it with him that frequenteth thoſe that giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to luſts &amp; pleaſures, albeit at the beginning he reſiſteth the euill, and for a while falleth not thereinto, yet by continuall hant, he finally falleth in with them. Furthermore, let vs ſhun Idlenes, the mother and nurſe of all miſchiefe, namely, of pleaſure, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaying of olde Cato, that by doing nothing, men learn to doo euill: and this doo we vndoubtedly finde to be moſt verified in the pleaſures of the fleſh. For as ſtill and ſtanding waters are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily corrupted, ſo are idle perſons. Beſides, there is nothing more repugnant to the true repentance of Gods children, either to our griefe, heauineſſe, and ſorrowing for our ſinnes, than pleaſure. For as it is vnnaturall to kindle fire with water, ſo is it vnpoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for pleaſure to breede in a penitent heart that ſorroweth for ſinne. <hi>The Lorde of hoaſtes,</hi> ſayth the Prophet Eſaie, <hi>in that daie did call you to weeping and mourning,</hi>

The Grecians in old time were noted to bee mightily giuen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and forced each other to drinke by a certaine meaſure,<note place="margin">Plutarch in the banquet of the 7. ſages.</note> as Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch noteth, alleadging to that purpoſe the authority of Homer, yea, they woulde haue no companie wyth thoſe that woulde not frame themſelues thereto, and thereof grew the prouerbe, which to this daie in theyr ſpeech ſignifieth, <hi>Either drinke, or be gone.</hi> Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie writeth, that in his time dronkenneſſe bare ſuch ſwaie in Italy,<note place="margin">Plut.

Which is worſe, the Tartarians, Perſians, and Grecians in theyr principall triumphs dyd celebrate dronkenneſſe, Mithridates preſumed to propound a reward to him that coulde drinke moſt, and carrie it awaie when hee had ouercome the reſt in drinking. Theſe examples do ſhew, that the older that dronkenneſſe is, the more haue men beene euermore inclined thereunto, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, doo admoniſh vs to beware thereof, yea, this exceſsiue diſorder that hath taken ſuch hold of diuers, ſhould teach vs both to abhorre and in time to reſiſt this corruption, leaſt by degrees we climbe to the tipe of all iniquitie.</p>

                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:18664:108"/>2 Neither is this dronkenneſſe anie whit diminiſhed in theſe daies among ſundrie nations, that beare the title of Chriſtians. Some doo not thinke their gueſts ſufficiently entertained, vntyll they haue forced them to drinke themſelues dronke. Of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancie and victorie do ſome greatly vaunt, boaſting that they can drinke much, and make their fellowes dronke. In ſome places ſo extreme is the exces, that he which is not diſpoſed to be as dronke as others, muſt ſhun certaine companies. See wee not, euen among thoſe that profeſſe the reformed religion (I cannot report it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhame and confuſion) that ſome wil haue their glaſſes without feet, to the end there be no waie to ſet them downe vntill all bee dronke? Others, who in ſtead of a foote, will haue a bell, that in ringing therof they may teſtifie their valiancie in drinking off all? Others that proceed farther, and in ſtead of a bel haue a die cloſed in it, wherewith to binde either himſelfe to drinke againe, or his neighbours, according to the number of the prickes thereof. A moſt deuilliſh inuention, whereby by the hazard applied to dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, to prophane Gods prouidence, and the vſe of wine, a moſt excellent creature. Other curſed inuentions there are, wherewith to binde men to drinke before they thirſt, euen to dronkennes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Yet are the inconueniences that therof doo inſue ſo apparant and griueous, and ſo noted euen by the heathen, that it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that Chriſtians ſhould not vtterly abhorre it.<note place="margin">Xenoph. in his firſt booke of the inſtit. of Cyrus.</note> When Aſtiages, father in law to Cyrus, asked him why he refuſed to drinke a cup of wine that was offered him, he anſwered: Becauſe I tooke it to bee poiſon: for this other day at a feaſt that thou madeſt to thy frinds, I ſawe that euerie one that drunke of it ſoone after decaied both in bodie and minde, as hauing loſt both ſenſe and vnderſtanding. The ſame did a Lacedemonian note, who beeing demanded why the Lacedemonians drunke ſo ſoberly.<note place="margin">Plut. in his Lacon. Apo.</note> To the end, ſaid he, that others ſhould not ſeeke or take counſell for vs, but wee rather for them: thereby ſhewing, that exceſſe of wine ſo weakneth mans vnderſtanding, that he is vnfit either to giue or aske counſell. And in truth there is no vice more repugnant to mans creation, who is endued with vnderſtanding and reaſon: for as by reaſon he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from a bruite beaſt, ſo when wine depriueth him of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon, it depriueth man of man, and placeth him in the degree of beaſts: and this is well noted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe, That there is ape dronke, hogge dronke, and lyon dronke. For as experience teacheth, ſome beeing dronke, doo growe lyke apes, full of follyes and toyes, ſome doo fall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18664:108"/> on ſleepe, and wallowe in theyr dennes lyke hogges: and ſome doo fall into quarrelling, brauling, and fighting, therein imitating the cruell nature of lyons. And therefore it were but a iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, if beaſts that drink to quench their thirſt, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into men, and men that drinke ſo farre aboue theyr thyrſt,<note place="margin">Seneca in his 84. Ep. to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> as to drowne theyr reaſon, were turned &amp; conuerted into beaſtes. What is dronkenneſſe, ſayth Seneca, other than a voluntarie mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? If thou couldeſt lengthen the eſtate of a dronken man into diuerſe daies, the world would iudge him to bee a foole or a mad man: Such as looſe theyr wits or reaſon by ſickneſſe or anie other inconuenience, are worthie of compaſsion, but the drunkard is the more abhominable, becauſe hee voluntarily depriueth himſelfe of his wits, and wittingly taketh vppon him the perſon of a beaſt and a madde man. And to this purpoſe, ſayth Plutarch, that euery honeſt man that bluſheth and is aſhamed of villanous &amp; infamous actions, muſt beware of dronkenneſſe. For, as ſome ſaie, Choler is in like degree as rage and furie, but dronkenneſſe lodgeth and dwelleth therewith, or rather is furie it ſelfe: leſſe in continuance, but more grieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Diſ. 3</note> engendered by dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, appeareth in many in apiſh behauiour, as is aforeſayde, by fooliſh wordes, and other vanities. In proofe heereof doth Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch alleadge this ſaying of Homer: Such is the ſtrength of wine, that it diſtracteth the wiſe man, it maketh the graueſt perſonages to ſing, laugh, toy, and daunce, and to reueale the things which he ſhould eſpeciallye conceale. Where Herodotus doeth ſaie, that wordes ſwimme vpon wine, hee meaneth, that wine maintaineth pratling, as water beareth vp the bodie that ſwimmeth. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference doth Plutarch make betweene a pratler and a dronken man, that the one ſpeaketh fooliſhly at the table, and the other in euerie place, yet doth not the dronken mans fooliſh and vaine pratling laſt while he is onely at the table, but ſo long as the wine ſumeth in his head: yea ſometimes it is ſo troubleſome, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and noiſome, that it is an intollerable burthen to bee forced to heare and to aunſwere thereto. And the ſame doeth Plutarch verie fitly note, ſaying: If a dronken man come to viſite a ſicke man, hee troubleth him more than his ſickneſſe. If hee bee in a ſhippe, hee more anoyeth the paſſengers than the ſalte water:<note place="margin">Horace in his Odes.</note> his praiſe of anie man is farre more cumberſome than his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe.</p>

And of this doth ordinarie experience giue vs a note in many at all times.<note place="margin">Horace in his Odes.</note> Horace ſayth, that pleaſant wine reuealeth ſecret counſels. The common prouerbe, <hi>In wine is truth,</hi> ſpeaketh more generally, and is confirmed by this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther olde prouerbe, <hi>That which the ſober man thinketh, the dronken man ſpeaketh.</hi> And in this ſenſe, ſaith an ancient Philoſopher, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Plut. of prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

And Cicero, among ſuch things as tend to procure credit when a man ſpeaketh truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſsimulation or lying, placeth childhood, dreames, impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, folly, and dronkenneſſe.

Iuſtine propoundeth a notable example in the Scithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of whome he ſaith, that they were ouercome firſt by wine, then by wepons. Neither are we to maruel that it commeth ſo to paſſe, for the dronkard peruerteth all that hee gouerneth, hee maketh his bodie to reele &amp; he along, he ſtoppeth and reuerſeth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall actions of his ſoule, he drowneth the ſhippe that he guideth, he ouerthroweth the chariot that hee driueth, he looſeth the army that hee leadeth, but, which is the fulneſſe of his miſhap, by dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, becomming twice a childe, hee reiecteth the gouernment of others, but chiefely the couenant of God, and ſo caſteth himſelf headlong into ruine and euerlaſting damnation.</p>

But eſpecially the remembrance of the ſpirituall dangers, miſchiefes, and inconueniences, euen of euerlaſting death: the fruites of this dronkenneſſe ought mightily to mooue our heartes wholly to renounce it. Firſt, as there is no exerciſe more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the children of God, for theyr ſaluation, or wherein God is greatlyer glorified, than in prayer, thankeſgiuing, and praiſes to the Lord: ſo is there nothing that ſooner quencheth the vſe of the ſame, than dronkenneſſe. Alſo, if ordinarie ſobrietie, yea, euen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie faſting bee ſometimes requiſite in praier, that wee may bee the better diſpoſed thereunto: what can the dronkardes praiers bee, but either none, or meere mockeries?

Firſt, as a long and ſore raine, ſayeth Saint Auguſtine, moyſtneth the earth, and ſo conuerteth it into mire, that it cannot bee tilled to bring foorth fruit: euen ſo our bodies diſtempered with too much wine, cannot receiue the ſpirituall husbandrie, neyther yeeld anie fruite beſeeming the immortall ſoule.<note place="margin">Chriſoſt. ho. 1. vpon theſe wordes, Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co vino, &amp;c.</note> Wee are, ſayth hee farther, to beware that our bodyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moyſtned with wine, growe not, as it were, into ſaltes or mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, where ther groweth nothing but weeds, frogges, ſerpents, and other lyke beaſtes. The dronkard, ſayth Chriſoſtome, is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie deuill, deuoid of excuſe for his deſtruction or obloquy with men.

Yet this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reprooued by a Heathen man, is in vſe among Chriſtians, yea and ſo, that ſome at the firſt ſitting downe will refraine from drinke, to the end, the better, as they tearme it, to beare the great blowes, that is, to drinke the great cuppes that ſhall come in the end.

               <p n="15">15 Some will reply, that albeit they drinke much, yet they do neuer ſo farre exceed, as to ouercome their ſenſes.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18664:112"/> ſwillers in of wine and ſtrong drinke.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Why, ſaie ſome, Is it not lawfull for one to drinke to another? Truely if men were ſo obliuious, as ſitting at the table and beeing thirſty, they could not remember to drinke, it were a deed of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; curteſie, by drinking to them to remember them to drinke: but when they remember to drinke before they thirſt, it is no great almes to drinke to them. True, but it is a teſtimonie of good will. Neither are wee ſo ſeuere or rigorous, as that wee will ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply condemne the cuſtome and vſe thereof: onely wee woulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this condition, that they ſhould abide within the bounds of amitie and ſobrietie, and not vnder the pretence of a teſtimonie of good will, to preſſe men to drinke more than they need, neither to force them to that which they falſely tearme, dooing of reaſon. For is there anie reaſon that a man ſhould drinke before he thirſt, or when hee cannot brooke it without his hurt? Is it a reaſonable requeſt, to vrge another to drinke as much as thy ſelfe? No, no more than to vrge him to eate as much as thy ſelfe: or, hauing leſſe feete, to weare as great ſhooes as thy ſelfe: or, to put as much wine in a little veſſell as thou canſt into a great. Others are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſaie, It is the cuſtome of the Countrie: but do they thinke, that that wil be a ſufficient excuſe in the ſight of God? A cuſtome repugnant to good manners, is no cuſtome, but a corruption and a vice that is to be reiected. Becauſe the Heathen in olde time dyd not account ſimple fornication betweene two vnmarryed perſons a ſinne, is it not therefore a ſinne worthie death and euerlaſting damnation? God wyll not iudge men after the cuſtome of the world and mans opinion, but according to his word.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Some wyll replie, that God created wine to reioyce mannes heart: but wyth Salomons mother wee will aunſwere, that it muſt bee giuen to thoſe that faint in ſorrowe,<note place="margin">Prou 31.6</note> whoſe heartes are in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, not to thoſe that are alreadie vnreaſonable, fat and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. It muſt (ſayth a certayne Heathen man) bee vſed ſoberly as a medicine. It muſt bee ſo vſed, as out of the ſweetneſſe of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour we may take occaſion to praiſe God for his goodneſſe, not to offend him by abuſing it. To bee ſhort, this vſe of wine to reioyce the heart, extendeth not to a brutiſh ioy, to conuert a man into an ape, an hog, or a lyon, as is aforeſayd, but to a ioy that ſtrengthneth both heart and bodie, preparing and diſpoſing euerie man to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelfe in his vocation.</p>

As when we ſee a man fall, wee will not fall as he doeth, but looke better to our ſeet, or els turne out of the waie, leaſt we ſhould fall as he did. Their example is but a repreſentation of mans frailty, that we may thereof gather this inſtruction.

               <p>THe other kind of luſt whereof we are now to intreat, is Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The holy Scriptures noting mans monſtrous corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be worſe than beaſts in this reſpect, propoundeth ſuch abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable kinds thereof, that chaſt eares doe euen abhorre to heare them named. They be ſins againſt nature, as in deed they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and therefore ſhall be iudged by all ſuch as denie not nature, common to man. As God alſo in his law hath commanded to root out ſuch people,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.20 Exod. 22 Gen. 19.</note> ſo his horrible vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce executed againſt Sodom and Gomorrha, ſhal take from ſuch monſters all excuſe in the day of iudgement. Neither ſhall they whom God hath raiſed to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power, if they be ſlacke to puniſh ſuch abhomination, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape Gods vengeance, as he well declared in the perſon of Philip king of Macedon, who for diſſembling the manifold complaints of Pauſanias, for the iniurie to him doone by Attalus in ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination, finally in his full and nuptiall triumph,<note place="margin">Iuſt. li. 9.</note> marching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Alexanders, the one his ſon, the other his ſon in law, loſt his life by the hands of the ſame Pauſanias, whome God made the executioner of his iudgement, to puniſh the kinges ſlackneſſe.

Neither may wee replie, that it is a precept of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. For in this reſpect the lawes of Heathen Emperours do concurre with the lawe of Moſes. And ſeeing that God hath pronounced, that for ſuch iniquitie the vnbeleeuers haue ben pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and driuen out of their countries,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.27 1.

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle likewiſe ſo ſharply reprouing the inceſtuous Corinthian, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commandeth to be deliuered to Satan, doth ſufficiently ſhew, that this law is perpetuall. And in deed, it is ſo rooted in mannes heart,<note place="margin">Tacit. l. 12 Sue. in the life of Claudius.</note> that when the Emperour Claudius would haue married his neece, his brothers daughter, he durſt not doo it vntill, as it were euen by force, he had wreſted a decree from the Senate of Rome, whereby it was decreed that ſuch a marriage ſhould be lawfull, yet durſt not anie after him and his example practiſe this wicked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, but onely one of his freed men, who did it to pleaſe his Lord.<note place="margin">Dieu in Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua.</note> The Emperour Nerua freed the Senate from this reproach, by aboliſhing this theyr permiſsion by an expreſſe prohibition, wherin he decreed that no man ſhould marry his brothers daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Leauing therefore theſe vnnaturall abhominations, wee wyll intreate onely of two kindes of fornication, too common euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, yet moſt pernitious and damnable.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The firſt is adulterie, wherein wee vnderſtand the ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by thoſe of whome either one or both are elſe where ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in marriage. True it is, that ſome euen in our dayes, namely, that miſerable Italian Apoſtata, Bernardine Ochin, hath mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that a married man may without adulterie marrie more wiues, eſpecially relying vppon the examples of Abraham, Iacob, Dauid,<note place="margin">Tremelius &amp; Iunius.</note> and other holie perſonages of the olde Teſtament. But we are to note, firſt that ſome learned men of our time are of opinion, that God in his lawe doth expreſly forbidde man to haue ſundrie wiues at once. And to that ſenſe doo they expound this place v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually tranſlated, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take a wife with her ſiſter during her lyfe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leuit. 18.18</note> which they tranſlate thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take a wife adioyning her to another,</hi> and this their tranſlation they confirme with ſtrong and ſound reaſons. Wherof it muſt folow, that ſuch as haue taken ſundry wiues together, haue tranſgreſſed the expreſſe law of God. And albeit this corruption was not in thoſe dayes (as it ſhoulde ſeeme) expreſſely reprooued in ſuch as were giuen therevnto, but rather by the Lorde tollerated and ſuffered vppon ſome
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18664:113"/> reaſons,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.18.</note> yet is it without doubt formally repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mariage. And indeed God ſaith, <hi>It is not good that man ſhould be alone, let vs make him a helper.</hi> Here he neither ſpeaketh of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry helpers, but of one only, neither created he for Adam ſundry wiues, but onely one.<note place="margin">Mat. 19, 5.</note> And Ieſus Chriſt expreſsing the meaning of Moſes, ſaith. <hi>And two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Thus he ſpeaketh of two, not of fower or ſiue in one fleſh. And for this cauſe albeit Idolatry be a more grieuous ſinne then Adulterie, yet doth Adulterie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolue marriage and miniſtreth iuſt cauſe of diuource,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.16.</note> becauſe the partie becommeth a member and is made one body with her, to whom he is adioyned by carnall copulation: and in that he can not be a member of both be breaketh the firſt bond. Whereof it neceſſarily enſueth that the married man companying, with a maide or a wife, and ſo becomming a member of her and one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy breaketh his bond with the firſt, and conſequently is an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer. And this is it which Ieſus Chriſt expreſly confirmeth, ſaiyng <hi>Who ſo putteth away his wife, except for whordome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and marrieth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, committeth adulterie.</hi> Here he euidently declareth that ſo long as the firſt bond remaineth in force, euen ſo long as he hath put her away without cauſe, ſo long can he take no other wife, vnleſſe he commit Adulterie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It alſo ſeemeth that Saint Paul ordaining that a Biſhop ſhould be the husband but of one wife,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.2.</note> did in his time tollerate this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in others, who hauing alreadie two wiues, embracing the Goſpell did conuert to Chriſtian religion. Yet in that he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euerie ſuch, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer excellencie in gifts, not to be called to any publique office in the Church, he thereby ſufficiently declareth it to bee a corruption and ſpot of reproch: And that ſurely hee would neuer haue ſuffered any profeſſor of Chriſtianitie to haue taken two wiues.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.2</note> As alſo hee plainely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his entent wher he ſaith: <hi>To auoide fornication let euery man haue his owne wife and euery wife her husband.</hi> Thereto adding, <hi>The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath no power of his owne body, but the wife,</hi> and thereby eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declaring, that if the husband taketh another wife, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth with her, hee doth iniurie to his firſt, in that without her conſent, he taketh vpon him to diſpoſe of that which is in her power, and ſeperateth himſelfe from her, to become one with her whom he then taketh. Is not this therefore directly repugnant to the prohibition of Saint Paule,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.5.</note> who willeth that one ſhould not defraud another? Hereto he addeth, <hi>For hee that is married careth for thinges of the world, how he may pleaſe his wife</hi> and is deuided. He
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18664:114"/> ſaith not, how he may pleaſe his wiues. But beſides, how ſhould he be deuided, if he had many? Albeit therfore that God in old time did beare with this corruption of hauing many wiues, yet doth it not follow that it was lawfull: But wee muſt ſo reſolue herein, as Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh of the booke of diuorce. <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it becauſe of the hardnes of your harts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.8. Inſtit. lib. 1. Tit. 10. de Nupt. § affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</note> 
                  <hi>but it was not ſo from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> Let vs therefore, with the Emperour Iuſtinian, conclude that it neuer was, nor neuer ſhall bee lawfull to take and haue two wiues at once. In correſpondence whereof if the married wife companieth with another, albeit vnmarried, yet ſhee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth adulterie: as alſo the man if hee take an other beſide his wife, albeit a ſingle woman, and holdeth her as his concubine, or taketh her to wife, or howſoeuer elſe, yet doth hee likewiſe commit adulterie.<note place="margin">Auguſtine of adulterie in married men to Pollent.</note> And indeede it were no equitie, ſaith Saint Auguſtine, that men ſhoulde require of their wiues that faith which themſelues will not performe. And thereupon in many other places hee vpholdeth that it is adulterie, if a man, by any meanes whatſoeuer, breaketh that faith of marriage whereto he is adioyned.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This point thus reſolued. Let euery one, man and woman, that is tyed by marriage, abhorre al carnall coniunction with any other then her to whom he is ſo tyed by marriage.

Saint Iohn deſcribeth vnto vs this wrath and condemnation in a fearefull manner,<note place="margin">Apoca. 21.8.</note> ſaying, <hi>The portion of the whoremongers ſhall bee in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> And to the ende to make them the more ſenſibly to feel that God hath reiected them Saint Paul commaundeth that they ſhould bee excommunicated, and that we ſhould forbeare to conuerſe with them,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.9.</note> vnleſſe to the end to bring them to repentance.</p>
               <p n="16">16 To conclude, let vs note the liuely &amp; pregnant reaſons that Saint Paul propoundeth to make vs to abhorre whoredome. <hi>Know you not</hi> ſaith he <hi>that your bodies are the members of Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall I then take the members of Chriſt &amp; make them the members of an harlot?</hi> Firſt let vs remember that our ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt concerneth not the ſoule only, but alſo the body, <hi>For wee are members of his fleſh and his bones.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.30.</note> Otherwiſe wee ſhould haue but a weake hope of the reſurrection, if the coniunction implyed not the whole perſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed both of the body and ſoule. And this our coniunction with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18664:118"/> him is ſuch that wee are all one with him, as being members of his body, &amp; taking life from the ſame ſpirit, as he alſo ſaith. <hi>Hee that is vnited and conioined to the Lord, is one ſelfe ſpirit.</hi> But what of al this?<note place="margin">1, Cor. 6.17.</note> Euen the ſame that S. Paul ſaith, <hi>Hee that committeth fornication ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a member from the body of Christ, &amp; maketh it a member of a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.</hi> And indeed as he addeth, <hi>He that coupleth himſelfe with a harlot is one body, as it is written. Two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> It muſt therefore of neceſsitie follow either that Chriſt muſt together with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his body, be taken and vnited to the harlot (which euen to imagine is moſt horrible) or els the member muſt be plucked from the body of Chriſt, when it is coupled and vnited vnto the harlot, which alſo is deteſtable, as he ſheweth, ſaying <hi>God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. His ſecond reaſon is this. Euery ſin that man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miteth is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body: but he that committeth whoredome ſinneth againſt his owne body. Which ſome do note, as if whoredome did therein print ſome greater blemiſh of villanie and infamie then any other ſin. As alſo S. Paul, ſpeaking of ſinne againſt nature, ſaith.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.</note> 
                  <hi>They haue defiled their owne bodies betweene themſelues.</hi> Otherwiſe, that he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt his owne body, in that he &amp; the whore with whom he ſinneth, are one body. Beſides, that beeing an excellent member of the body of Chriſt, he ſinneth deeply againſt his body in pulling it off from the body of Chriſt and making it a member of a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous whore, and thereby becomming one body with her,</p>
               <p n="18">18 Saint Pauls third argument is this. Our bodies are the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holy Ghoſt. But the holy Ghoſt cannot abide in any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane or polluted place: We do therfore by whoredome driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the holy ghoſt &amp; make our ſelues an habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the vnclene ſpirit, which is the Deuil. To conclude, he ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6,</note> we are no longer our owne, &amp; why? <hi>Becauſe God hath bought vs with a price.</hi> In that he deliuered his ſon Ieſus Chriſt to the death for vs. <hi>And therefore,</hi> as he addeth, <hi>we are to glorify God in our bodies &amp; in our ſpirits, which are his,</hi> &amp; not to commit ſuch villanous ſacriledge as forſaking God to giue to a whore that which is not our owne, but Gods.</p>
               <p n="19">19 What are we then to do?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.18.</note> Euen to the end to amend our liues according as Ieſus Chriſt admoniſheth &amp; commandeth vs, we are to put in practiſe the ſame wherto Saint Paul exhorteth vs: ſaying: <hi>Flie fornication,</hi> therby declaring that it is our dutie ſo to abhor it, that in liew of ſeeking after it we flie from it,<note place="margin">Hierome in his Epiſtles. Greg. in his Moralles.</note> as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a moſt perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, damnable and accurſed peſtilence, and to the ſame purpoſe let vs remember the ſaying of Saint Hierome. Oh how ſharpe is the fruite of whoredome? It is more bitter then Gaule, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18664:119"/> more cruell then the ſword: and diligently let vs meditate vpon the ſaying of another Doctor: When whoredome hath once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken holde of a mans vnderſtanding, ſhee will hardly ſuffer him to thinke of any goodnes. For the deſires of man (are as it were) glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18664:119"/> wherof is growne this prouerbe <hi>After the paunche came the daunce.</hi> And indeede dauncing is ſeldome vſed in the morninges, or whiles men bee faſting.

And Baſill reprouing the dances vſed in his time, layeth the blame vpon wine. If dances therefore vſually bee the fruites of Idolatrie and drunkenneſſe, who dare aduow the fruite of ſuch trees to be good.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Well, let vs now conſider of the dance it ſelfe. The caperings, iumpes, gambolds, turnings, windings, courteſies, paces, firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then backward, wheeling about, ſtamping vpon the ground, with other like toies, follies &amp; vanities, what els do they repreſent, but the geſtures rather of a franticke or mad-man, then of a ſober perſon? Their skips and wanton friskes doe better beſeeme Kids or Gotes, as by the tearme of capraying themſelues do confeſſe: or rather Apes as a certaine heathen Poet hath noted, ſaying:<note place="margin">Ouid in his Metam,</note> Iupiter being offended with a people that gaue themſelues too much to dancing, transformed them into Apes. Whereby hee declareth vnto vs that ſuch as follow dancing are vnworthie to bee recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among men, but rather deſerue to bee transformed into Apes. Alſo that the heathen and their Gods were of the ſame opinion. But albeit we leaue them the name of men, yet are we to eſteeme them but as drunken and mad men, conſidering their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces and geſtures quite altered from the ſhape of ſober and wiſemen. And among the Romaines it was an approued ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that none ſhoulde dance but ſuch as were either mad or drunke. Beſides if from a farre off wee ſhoulde ſee ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye dancing and leaping, and heare no noyſe of Muſicke or ſinging, we ſhould veryly take them to bee mad-drunken, or diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raught of their wittes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And as for ſuch as being giuen to dancing cannot broke to be thought drunke or beſides their wittes, yet muſt they at the leaſt confeſſe that moſt of them are led by ſome pleaſures of the fleſh, which will engender filthy and curſed concupiſcence, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would induce them to fornication,<note place="margin">Sueton. in Catelin.</note> were it not that God by his power, and in mercy doth mightilie reſtraine them. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect hath a heathen man tearmed dances the inſtruments of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: Others, the Deuils baudery, as wee ſhall heereafter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Is it not therfore the ſhameleſſe impudencie and inuention of the Deuill, euen among Chriſtians to admit of the erection of publique ſchooles, to teach dancing, that is to ſay, to transforme
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18664:120"/> youth into Apes,<note place="margin">Ouid:</note> drunkerds or mad men, and to giue precepts how to intiſe mens harts to luſt and fornication? The time was when a heathen Emperor baniſhed a heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Poet, for writing a litle booke of the Art of loue: Yet can we Chriſtians alow of ſchooles wherin to teach the practiſe, alurements, and occaſions to draw, or bee drawen into fornication. But it were rather to be wiſhed that theſe dancers, men or women would carefully apply themſelues in the ſchoole of the holy Ghoſt, which is the heauenly doctrine, to ſtudy how to forget dancing, in ſuch manner that neither it, neither any ſuch folly, vanity or wantonnes might henceforth be remembred among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Now let vs ſee what is taught in this ſchoole for the reiecting, condemning, &amp; vtter aboliſhing of ſuch dances as we ſpeake of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the memoriall of the ſame.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 43.</note> Firſt, S.

And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all theſe ſports, toyes, ſollies, gamboulds, &amp; other vanities vſed in dances? And doth not experience teach that drunkenneſſe is vſually accompanied with ſuch inſolencie, and profane &amp; vaine ſongs? And fornication with ſuch villanous ſpeeches &amp; ſongs, toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, geſtures, &amp; other laſciuious faſhions practiſed in dances? what elſe are dances therefore but the inſolencies, fruits, pathes and in a maner vnſeparable companions both to whoredome &amp; drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? And conſequently who ſeeth not that dances and al depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances thereof are by the ſpirit of God prohibited in that it doth forbid all wantonneſſe, fornication and drunkenneſſe.</p>

               <p n="9">9 Now to proceede to another conſideration. By three principal points we may iudge whether our deeds and works be good. Firſt, whether they concurre with our vocation: Secondly, whether they edifie our neighbours: Laſtly, whether they tend to the glory of God. As concerning our vocation, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in this: That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from ſin do ſhe from it, and ſhunne all apparance of euill. As touching edification, the ſame reſteth in this, that our conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſuch as may beſeeme the profeſsion of the Goſpell, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be induced to embrace &amp; follow the ſame. And for the glory of God, Saint Paul ſaith. <hi>Whether we eate or drinke, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we doe, let all be done to the honour and glory of God.</hi> Now we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our eating and drinking to the glorie of God, when wee vſe the ſame in ſoberneſſe and thankeſgiuing, that wee may euerie of vs bee the better diſpoſed to ſerue God in our vocations. The like is in our ſleepe, and all other the recreations of our bodies or
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18664:121"/> mindes. But is not dauncing directly repugnant to our vocation, becauſe that where we ſhould ſhunne ſinne and all apparance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, with all occaſions and allurements thereto, it miniſtereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but apparance and entiſement to the ſame? Likewiſe, for the edification of our neighbours. This folly and vanitie is to no other vſe, but to be an offence vnto them, in that thereby the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſeeme to inferre, that the Goſpel therein concurreth with the world and the fleſh, conſidering that we that profeſſe the Goſpell, and therefore ought to renounce ſuch vanitie, are ſo bent &amp; giuen thereunto. And as touching the glorie of God, what dancer dare be ſo impudent, as to mayntaine that God is glorified in dancing, either that hee danceth to the ende to glorifie God, or to bee the more apt to ſerue him in his vocation? Moreouer, the rule of good workes reſteth not in the cuſtome and vſe of the world, but in the teſtimonie of the will of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="25">25 For the teſtimonie of the truth heereof wee wyll alleadge ſome parte of his writinges.<note place="margin">Cic. for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena, orat. 25.</note> Lucius Murena was a noble man and choſen to bee Conſull at Rome, ſome enuiers of his aduancement, and his enemyes, to the ende to declare him vnworthie that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, accuſed him of many crimes, among the reſt, that hee had daunced. Cicero who had vndertaken his defence, comming to that point of the accuſato<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i, ſayth not that it was no fault to dance, and ſo the ſame was a vaine obiection: but acknowledgeth it in deede to bee a greate fault, and therefore for his clyent ſayeth, that there was no apparance to beleeue that Murena daunced: his reaſons: becauſe dauncing is euermore accompanyed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18664:126"/> other vices. As alſo that a man coulde not giue himſelfe to dancing, vnles he were eyther dronke or mad. That the vices that miniſter preſumption of dauncing, (as the cauſes of their effectes) are for the moſt parte villanous and diſſolute banquets, dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luſt, and fornication: But no man coulde accuſe Muraena of anie ſuch, and therefore it was not to bee thought that euer hee daunced. Heere wee ſee, that among the Romanes dauncing was a great fault, verie ignominious, and ſufficient to denounce a man vncapable of preferment in the common wealth. Alſo, that they were reſolued, that dauncing was alwayes accompanyed wyth mightie and moſt villanous vices. To bee ſhort, that a vertuous man woulde neuer daunce. All this was thought moſt true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romanes. Otherwyſe, neither had Cato accuſed Murae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na for dauncing, neither had Cicero alleadged this ground for his defence.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Agayne, Deiotarus a king in Aſia, beeing lykewiſe accuſed before Caeſar for dauncing at a banquet, the ſame Cicero in his defence for that crime, declared that there was no ſuch preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuch a man: firſt, becauſe hee was a king, who vſed not to be dronke: next, that hee reſembled not many other kinges, ſuch as preſuming of theyr lybertie, applyed themſelues to all ryot and luſtfull pleaſure. But that he was a modeſt, ſober, and ſtay de man, one who in his youth gaue himſelfe to more honeſt exerciſes, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Heere agayne wee ſee, that the Romanes were fully perſwaded, that dauncing and dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe went commonly together: that they are exerciſes more fit for men drowned in pleaſures, than for ſuch as are endued with modeſtie: alſo that all young princes well brought vp, omitting all ſuch vanitie, ſhould giue themſelues to the exerciſes of vertue.</p>
               <p n="27">27 The ſame Cicero, after his returne from exile, repreſenting to the Senate the life and behauiour of one of his enemies, Aulus Gabimus, among other the good qualities of a ruffian and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſon, entituleth him to be a gallant dancer, and verſe nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hauing alſo to deale with Anthonie, a man drowned in all kinde of vice, among other his reproches of fornication and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie dronkenneſſe, he alſo obiecteth that hee had danced. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to let vs adde the ſaying of the ſame Orator in his third booke of Offices. There hee ſheweth, that a wiſe man, ſuch a one as maketh account, or profeſſeth vertue, ſhould neuer meddle with any ſuch villanous or diſhoneſt action, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer greate
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18664:126"/> profite might be gotten thereby. And for example, he putteth this caſe: If a man by Will ſhould chance to bequeath to one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth vertue, two or three millions of crownes, vpon condition, that before he tooke poſſeſsion of this legacy, he ſhould come into the common place, and there dance, and that he ſhould promiſe ſo to doo: he hereupon demandeth, whether this man in performing his promiſe, and dancing in the face of the world, ſhould ſhew him ſelfe either vertuous or wiſe: Then he aunſwereth, that hee ought not to haue promiſed, ſo had he ſhewed his grauitie. Likewiſe, that hee ought not for anie thing to doo that which in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imported anie villanie. Theſe ſentences of Cicero a hethen, may bee a reproch and iuſt condemnation againſt Chriſtians, with whome dancing is ſo common, that ſome haue erected publyke ſchooles wherein to teach dancing.</p>
               <p n="28">28 All the premiſes tending to condemne dauncing, might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to cut off all replication: yet leaſt wee ſhould omit anie thing that might make with the atturneys thereof, and dazell the eies of the fleſh enclined to this corruption: we will anſwere to theyr v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall propoſitions in defence thereof. Firſt, they obiect that wee ſeeke to aboliſh all pleaſure &amp; recreation, which were a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to nature, to right and reaſon, conſidering that reſt and recreation are as neceſſarie as meate, drinke, ſleepe, and ſuch lyke, which wee vſe for the preſeruation of lyfe. But we do confeſſe, that both bodie and minde doo require recreation. Yet albeit it bee permitted ſometimes to take recreation, it doth not therfore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they muſt bee allowed to dance. All recreations are not permitted, otherwiſe it would be lawfull for men to recreate them ſelues in lewd and fooliſh ſpeeches, in dronkennes, fornication, &amp;c. But all recreation muſt tend to prepare vs either in body or mind to our vocation: euerie other recreation conioyned with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of euill, occaſion or entiſement to wantonneſſe, or offence to our neighbour, is by Gods mouth accurſed. To be ſhort, euerie recreation repugnant to the modeſtie, temperance, and holines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Chriſtians, is to be condemned and reiected. Therefore this obiection is falſe, If it bee lawfull to take recreation, it is alſo lawfull to dance.</p>
               <p n="29">29 They alſo replie: To leape, friske, and daunce, are thinges indifferent, therefore to make them a ſinne is iniurie to Chriſtian libertie. Wee aunſwere: Thoſe thinges are indifferent, which with faith and for the glory of God, &amp; without danger of offence, a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18664:127"/> man may eyther doo or leaue, as to eate fleſh or to eate none, but dances cannot be drawen into that compaſſe. The vanities, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and exceſsiue ſport of dances, the ordinarie companions to dronkenneſſe, the manifeſt allurements to laſciuiouſneſſe, and the apparant occaſions of ſundry notable inconueniences doo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde them to be accounted among things indifferent. For it were meere impudencie to maintaine, that ſuch vanitie or corruption may pleaſe God, and ſo wee may applie our ſelues thereto in faith, which if wee haue not, all that wee doo is ſinne. Alſo, albeit wee ſhould admit them (which we cannot) to be things indifferent,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23 Rom 14 1. Cor. 8.13</note> yet ought we to practiſe the ſame which Saint Paule proteſteth, That rather than to offend our neighbour, for whom Ieſus Chriſt hath dyed, we will neuer vſe it while we liue.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Some do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that in deed ther is abuſe, yet the ſame may be taken awaie, &amp; not the whole exerciſe therof ſimplie condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This reformation were good in things of themſelues good as thus. Wee muſt not aboliſh the vſe of the Sacramentes, becauſe they haue bene abuſed, but we muſt take awaie the abuſe. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die becauſe it is ſicke muſt not bee killed, but the feauer taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie: but dances conſidered in theyr originall, in theyr forme, in their ends and naturall vſe cannot be placed in this courſe: but as things in themſelues and in euerie their partes vicious, they are to bee aboliſhed: Euen as a tree venimous in her leaues, fruites, and bodie, muſt not be lopped, but quite cut downe by the roote. But let vs aske theſe reformers of dances what they thinke good to be taken awaie? Some will ſaie, all laſciuious ſongs: others will adde, that women and maides ſhall not bee mixed with men and young frie. This is ſomewhat, yet not all. Some will go farther, and ſaie, let him that liſt to leape &amp; dance, do it priuatly in his chamber, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. All theſe reformations in deed, will cut off moſt part of our dances, which cannot be performed but in companie, &amp; cauſe men to looſe all affection and vſe of the ſame. For take away the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men and women, the lewd ſonges and tunes, the publyke mirth and paſtime, the ſpeeches, communication, and geſture that proceed of the fleſh and the world, who will dance? Such a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation will vtterly aboliſh all dances: ſo vicious, infected, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt they are in themſelues. As alſo there is no reforming of the ſtewes but by taking of them awaie.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Some wyll ſaie, If it bee not lawfull to daunce, farewell all good fellowſhippe. Truelie it were farre more wiſedome to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18664:127"/> forbeare ſuch fellowſhip, than thereby to ſtand in danger of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God. But if we chance thereinto, let vs practiſe the counſell of Saint Paul, &amp; not participate in the vnfruitfull workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but reproue them, not in wordes onely, but alſo in deeds, that our conſtant deniall to dance, may be a reall reprehenſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reproofe of ſuch as do dance.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Others will replie, that if they denie to dance,<note place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>5.</hi>11</note> they ſhall bee tearmed hypocrites &amp; ſcrupulous perſons. But it is better wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to beare ſuch tants, than to ioyne with the wicked, &amp; worke wickedneſſe with them. Alſo, what reaſon is it that hee that doeth euill, ſhould haue more power to draw vs to do euil with him, than wee by our conſtancie to drawe him to vertue? In this caſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were good to practiſe the decrees of the auncient counſels, which command, that when wee haue ſoberly and honeſtly eaten and dronken together, if anie prepare to dance, we ſhould depart awaie from theyr ſocietie. But they will replie, that ſo we ſhall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter offence to ſome: yet is it more tollerable ſo to doo, than to offend God. Beſides,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.4</note> Saint Peter armeth vs agaynſt this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aduertiſing vs that worldlings wyll bee grieued, if we runne not wyth them to the ſame exceſſe of ryot. But the worſt they can ſaie of vs, ſhall be, that we would not dance, that is, that we would doo nothing vnbeſeeming Chriſtians. And this conſtancie maye peraduenture touch ſome, of the company, &amp; procure them alſo to leaue ſuch inſolencie and riot. Howſoeuer it bee, there can bee no excuſe in the ſight of almightie God to doo euill. And better it is, to be a lyght in theſe darkneſſes and diſordered companies, than to ſuffer our ſelues to be lead by the blinde, and to followe theyr faults and ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Some will alleadge diuerſe the profites that come of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. Firſt, that it is an exerciſe fit for health, but the iudgments of the Phiſitions doo ſaie otherwiſe: for all vehement exerciſes are dangerous after meate, and commonly dancing followeth the full belly. Beſides that, theyr owne conſciences doo teſtifie, that in dancing the bodily health is the leaſt parte of the minde: yea, if wee may beleeue experience, wee ſhall finde that by the violent motions of dauncing, more haue incurred mortall ſickneſſe, than bodily health. Likewiſe, albeit dancing might be healthfull to the bodie, yet beeing ſo preiudiciall to the ſoule, as is before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wee are to forbeare the ſame. The vſe of fleſh is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the preſeruation of lyfe, than dauncing: yet doeth Saint Paule ſaie, that <hi>rather will hee eate no fleſh while hee liueth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.13</note> 
                  <hi>than
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18664:128"/> he will offend his brother.</hi> How much ſooner would he haue proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of dancing? Others doo propound agilitie of the bodie. But as this agilitie is not required in all, ſo doo they not in dancing prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the getting of it, but rather to boaſt of that which they haue, and therein to take a pride. Withall, there bee many other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes farre exempt from ſuch daungers of the ſoule as wee finde in dancing.</p>
               <p n="34">34 But among all commodities and profits by dancing, ſome do alleadge that they bee pathes to marriage, and meanes to attayne thereto. But how? As when Herodias daughter had pleaſed He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod in dauncing, hee offered her the one halfe of his kingdome: ſo ſome noting the grace, geſture, and amorous behauiours of ſome dancers, doo fall into liking, and ſo doo offer vnto them their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and goods, crauing and taking them to their wiues. But this allegation doth euidently confirme our former demonſtrations, that dances are bellowes to kindle the hearts in luſt. Beſides, that albeit they may bring forth marriage in ſome, yet ſurely not in the thirtith part of thoſe that by dances are inflamed and mooued to luſt. And therefore as ſuch luſts are accurſed by God, euen ſo are the dances that breede and inflame them. Moreouer, what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God are men to attend of ſuch mariages, practiſed by ſuch daungerous, vicious, and offenſiue means, ſo repugnant to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and holyneſſe that is required in the children of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, marriages forced by luſt, are for the moſt part vnequall, yet cannot bee reſtrained, neyther the luſt quenched, but by conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the marriage, and therefore can yeelde no better fruites but trouble and other inconueniences: ſo that it were better to roote out dancing out of the common wealth, than to miniſter occaſion of ſuch wretched marriages. So many vices therefore accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dancing, we ought with Cicero, to reſolue neuer to daunce, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thereby wee might gaine a million of golde, eſpecially if wee remember the ſaying of the holie Apoſtle Saint Paule, that <hi>wee must not doo euill that good may come of it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> Such holy thinges as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage muſt bee dealte in, in holyneſſe and lawfully. Beſides, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vices and pernitious dangers concurring in daunces, can bee no beginning or foundation of anie good worke.</p>
               <p n="35">35 Our dauncers atturneys alleadge ſome examples out of the holy Scripture for theyr allowance. Marie, ſaie they, the ſiſter of Moſes and Aaron, daunced among the women of Iſrael, after theyr paſſage ouer the redde ſea. When Dauid had ouercome Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah, the women of Iſrael daunced. When Iudith returned from
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18664:128"/> the ſlaughter of Holophernes, the wiues of Bethulia daunced. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid alſo leaped and daunced before the arke of the Lorde. But to take ſome ground in theſe examples: Firſt,<note place="margin">Exod 15.20. 1. Sam. 18.6 Iud. 15.14 2. Sam. 6.16</note> in our dances it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that women and maides ſhould dance aparte, wythout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie companie of men and batchelers. Secondlye, it were ſit that our dancing ſhoulde bee accompanyed wyth ſuch ſonges as tend to the honour and glorie of God, and that the ſame might bee the purpoſe of our dancing, as in olde time it was. And therefore theſe examples are as ſit to approue the dances of our dayes, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the coniunction of man and woman in the holy eſtate of Matrimonie, maye be to allowe theyr coniunction in the ſtewes. Moreouer, how few examples can wee finde of women that daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in olde time? And of men all the holy Scripture mentioneth onely Dauid, who daunced before the Arke of the Lorde in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and holy reioycing. For as concerning that hee ſayeth, <hi>Thou haſt turned my mourning into dauncing.</hi> Alſo that Ieremie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, <hi>Thou ſhalt bee adorned with thy timbrels, O virgin Iſrael,</hi>

                  <hi>and ſhalt goe foorth in the daunce of them that bee ioyfull.</hi> Lykewiſe that which the bleſſed Euangeliſt Saint Luke reporteth, that after the prodigall childe was returned,<note place="margin">Luke 15.15 Math. 15.16</note>

As lykewiſe the laying of Ieſus Chriſt of vſurers, in the parable of the talents. Alſo of the vniuſt ſteward commended for the wrong done to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, doo tend neyther to approue vſury, neyther to teach ſeruants to robbe theyr maſters: but that euery one ſhoulde faythfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie the giftes and graces that wee haue receiued of the Lorde, and liberally diſtribute to the poore of thoſe gifts that God hath giuen vnto vs. Neyther may we denie but that ſome abuſed their daunces euen in thoſe dayes,<note place="margin">Math. 25.27 Luke 16.8</note> as appeareth in the example of the daughters of Siloh, who while they danced, were rauiſhed by the Beniamites, and ſo receiued the reward and recompence of theyr vanitie. Finally, ſuch daunces as in olde time reſembled ours in theſe dayes, were neuer propounded as examples to bee i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated and followed,<note place="margin">Iud. 21.21.</note> no more than all other corruptions and abuſes whatſoeuer, that haue beene euer ſince the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Others there bee that doo deſyre, that at the leaſt wee woulde permitte and ſuffer ſuch daunces onelie to bee vſed,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18664:129"/> as by example are allowed in the holy Scriptures. Euen Martine Bucer, an excellent Doctour of our time, is of opinion, that they ſhould bee ſo reeſtabliſhed among Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Bucer of the kingdome of Chriſt. l. 2. c. 34</note> But wee wyll aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Firſt, that vſe wyll ſoone be worne out. For dancing would quayle, if men ſhoulde not bee mixed with women, eyther that they ſhoulde ſing nothing but the praiſes of God. Beſides, they ſhuld not be often in vſe, but only vpon occaſion of ſome victory, or other extraordinarie benefit from God. Withall, we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that theſe holy dances were as dependances of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ceremonies, in liew whereof Chriſtians haue in theſe dayes, prayers, praiſes, and thankes giuinges, with much greater ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
               <p n="37">37 But ſaie ſome, if at marriage feaſts, and other great meetings men ſhould not dance, they would do worſe. For either they wold fall to drinking, or elſe batchelers and maidens falling into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, would paſſe the time in more liberal communication &amp; free behauiour, and ſo miniſter occaſion of farther inconueniences: all which by dancing might bee preuented. Thus for the ſhunning of one wickedneſſe, they can diſpenſe to commit another, and ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themſelues with a wet ſacke. Oh woorde and deede vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie a Chriſtian! That we ſhould bee ſo peruerſe and corrupt, that wee muſt needes offend God in one ſorte, that wee may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him in another: That wee cannot auoyd ſinne but by ſinne: That wee muſt needes followe one beaten path to hell, that wee may eſcape another: Yet is this all that they do conclude, who for the auoyding of dronkenneſſe, vpholde that men muſt daunce. It is but an inſtruction how to argue which ſinnes are greater or ſmaller, and to diſpenſe wyth the leſſer, that wee may eſchue the greater. But how ſhall they paſſe awaie the time, ſaie they? Alas, Time wyll awaie faſt enough when wee are diſpoſed ſo to looſe and abuſe it. This is faire from the practiſe of the Apoſtle Saint Paules commaundement afore mentioned, <hi>Redeeme the time:</hi> conſidering we haue but too much time,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.16</note> when we know not how to ſpende it vnleſſe wee offend God.

               <p n="38">38 Wel we know that ther be dances that ſeem graue &amp; modeſt, as in many parts of Germanie.

This once laide for a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are to note that ther are ſome paſtimes which conſiſt in the exerciſe of the body, as ſhooting, either in the long bow or cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp;c. Fence, leaping and other ſuch like: Others in dexteritie of the mind, as Cheſte and Draughts. Theſe games and paſtimes, and ſuch like are, as things indifferent, lawfull &amp; tollerable among Chriſtians, ſo long as they be practiſed for this profit, namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the mind weried with ordinary buſines, to the end afterward to return more cheerfully to the ſame. As alſo are ſuch bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes as breed dexteritie &amp; ſtrength for the better employment in the ſeruice of the common wealth. But heere wee are to reſpect three points. Firſt that we do not ſo exceede in them as thereby to neglect the dutie of our vocation: for ſo in liew of redeeming time we ſhould both looſe and abuſe it. Secondly that we refraine ſuch exerciſe and play for money. For play is no meanes alowed by the lawes either of God or man, to get or to ſpend mony in, which God deliuereth into our hands to be faithfully diſpoſed or poſſeſſed in a good conſcience. Laſtly it is another caſe, when the Maieſtrate propoundeth ſome price or reward for bodily exerciſes, to the end thereto to inuite his ſubiects, and to make them more willingly to accomodate themſelues to the ſeruice of the common wealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There be other games which depend vpon Lots, chance, and hazard, as Dice and Cardes, ſignified by the Latine word <hi>Alea.</hi> As for ſuch games, we ſay it is meete for Chriſtians to forbeare them. Firſt, it may bee implyed that they are forbidden in the third co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the law.<note place="margin">Act 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine.</hi> For indeede the vſe of lots or hazard is to referre to the wiſedome, prouidence and power of God, whatſoeuer is acted among men. As the lot whereby Matthias was choſen to bee an Apoſtle was a demonſtration that God who knoweth the hartes, had choſen him, as we may alſo inferre by the praier of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les before the lot was call.<note place="margin">Prou. 16.33.</note> And this did wiſe Salomon note, ſaying <hi>The lot is cast in the boſome, but the iudgement is in the Lord.</hi> We may therefore lawfully vſe lots in matter of conſequence, wherein the will of God is extraordinarily to be ſought, either to auoide qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels &amp; controuerſies, or to preuent ſubornations or vnderminings, as in elections of Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Prou, 18.18.</note> ſharing of goods, and ſuch like. And this doth Salomon alſo meane where hee ſayth. <hi>The lot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtrife and maketh particion among the mightie.</hi> But to applie the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18664:130"/> lot and conſequently Gods prouidence to our vaine and friuolous pleaſures, manie times in matters of offence to God we may well ſay that ſo we doe abuſe them and take the name of God in vaine.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Secondly. Paſtime permi ted and by God alowed among men, muſt haue relation to ſome profit either of body or of mind: otherwiſe it is but Idleneſſe and time loſt for the which wee muſt render accompt vnto God. But theſe paſtimes of Cardes and Dice, as all men know, doe imply no exerciſe of the bodie: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they containe any recreation of the mind: For as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, the euent of the chance that they expect doeth driue either ſide into the like griefe &amp; heauineſſe, ſo as for the moſt part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is no farther content or recreation of minde, then as may grow of couetouſneſſe, if a man winne the money, or of an imagination of God, fauour, directing the chance in ſuch vaine and friuolous occaſions. If they be ſuch games as together conſiſt of chance, and induſtrie or agilitie of witte: yet as chance doe therein eſpecially gouerne: So is it the onely chance of the caſt which if it be good, reioyceth vs, if bad, driueth vs into griefe and ſorrow. Thus may euery man vnderſtand that theſe games which tend to no profit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of body or mind are both Idle and hurtfull workes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Thirdly the occaſion of theſe games at hazard is vſually a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous deſire by play to get into our hands other mens goods And indeede experience teacheth that all our play is for money. And hereof ariſeth an infinit nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of moſt pernitious miſchiefes. Firſt the looſer, thinking that his loſſe groweth not of the mans induſtry but of chance and hazard, hopeth for change of chance, with reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of his loſſe: and this cauſeth him obſtinately to continue the game in hope of gaine: &amp; conſequently great loſſe of goods, if the chance run againſt him: ſometime of all that himſelfe hath, or they that will lend vnto him: and hereof came the ſaying: <hi>Dice &amp; Cards haue beggered me:</hi> But wher exerciſe of the body or induſtry of mind without chance, do beare ſway, the game is more moderate. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the body can beare no more labour: or the minde finding the aduerſe partie more skilful and readie in the game, baniſhing all hope of winning, cauſeth vs to abſtaine from play. Who then will not confeſſe it to bee euill doone to waſt all the night and daie in play? To bee great crueltie, to waſt and ſo wretchedly to conſume the goods wherewith the wife and children ſhould bee nouriſhed and ſuſtained? That the Article of expence of ſo much goods in play wil neuer be alowed in the accompts of the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? That he which wineth mony at play hath no more right to keep it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18664:131"/> than a theefe? That if it be not lawfull for the looſer to looſe it, it is not lawfull for the winner to retaine it? And indeede no vſurie is ſo exceſsiue and hurtfull, as the gaine made by gaming, wherein without loane or labour, a man ſometime winneth all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moreouer. As the pleaſure of gaine and the ſorrow for loſſe in play are mightie paſsions to moue the harts: ſo what a number of brauſes, quarrels and controuerſies doe ariſe of play? What ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, curſing &amp; blaſpheming of God? Or who will not adiudge the tree that bringeth forth ſuch fruit, to be naught and worthie to be cut down or rooted vp? For in this conſideration haue ſuch games bin euer more deteſted, euen among the heathen. There is among the Pandects a law that ſaith.<note place="margin">Digeſt. lib. 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Aſconius Pedianus vpon the ſecond booke of Cicero of diuination, ſaith, that in olde time ſuch gameſters were at Rome condemned in fower times ſo much as they played.

                  <note place="margin">Cyprian of dycing and dicers.</note>6 As concerning the Doctors of the Church. Among the reſt, Saint Cyprian hath written a treatiſe expreſly to ſhew in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and abhomination Chriſtians ſhould holde theſe games of Chance and Hazard. Among other things he ſaith, that gaming
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18664:131"/> is a ſnare &amp; inuention of the Deuil, which he purpoſedly forged to maintaine Idolatrie in greater vſe &amp; commendation among men. And indeed as ſom are of opinion that Mercury a God of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then inuented Dice and Cards: ſo S. Cyprian ſayth, that he cauſed himſelfe to be painted vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, willing that at the beginning of their play they ſhould ſacrifice vnto him: And this ſacrifice or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage conſiſteth in kiſsing the Card or the Die, or in pouring forth of wine in honor of this painting, or in ſome ſuch like ceremonie. That Chriſtians retaining the game haue onely changed the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in ſtead of Mercurie pictured a King, a Queene, and a varlet. What elſe is it then to play at Cardes and Dice, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the workes of the Deuill, deuiſed for our deſtruction, and to refreſh the memorie of &amp; in part to confirme the auncient Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, which wee ought to aboliſh out of all memorie among vs? The Deuill, ſaith Cyprian, is preſent at our play, and lurketh to catch vs, and hauing taken vs, to triumph ouer vs. And indeed in theſe games we finde nothing but deceite, lying, folly, rage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, wrath, diſſention, redineſſe to iniurie, cruel boldneſſe, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonious, and fretting minds, waſting of goods, time and honour, yea ſometimes ſtripes and murder. Thou player at Dice &amp; Cardes, ſaith he, that tearmeſt thy ſelfe a Chriſtian, thou art none indeede: for thou art too much addicted to worldly pleaſure, and canſt not be a friend to Chriſt, ſo long as thou delighteſt in the inuentions of his enemie, the Deuill. O daungerous hand, and tormenter of his maſter, which can neuer forbeare playe, either winning or looſing.</p>
               <p n="7">7 An other Doctor named Nicholas Lira in a ſmall tract called <hi>Preceptorium</hi> aledgeth nine reaſons, by the which hee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that playes are not to be admitted among Chriſtians, but are to be baniſhed out of the Church of God. Likewiſe Lambert Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus a profeſſor of deuinitie, and a learned and godly man did lately publiſh a declaration concerning the games of Chance or Hazard, where out I haue taken part of this here written, wherein at large he declareth them to be vnlawfull. The reaſon therefore, before conſidered, the authority of the word of God: of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the Church: of the lawes both ciuill and canon, &amp; the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the very heathen, ought to make vs to abhorre and deteſt ſuch games, as matters vnworthy of Chriſtians, euen of men crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to farre better purpoſe. And indeede when Chylon was ſent from Lacedemonia to Corinth, to conclude aliance betweene the two nations, finding the gouernours playing at Dice, hee returned
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18664:132"/> without any ſpeech of his charge, ſaying: He would not defame the Lacedemonians, with ſo great a reproch as to enter ſocietie with Dicers. How much leſſe ought Chriſtians then to abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing their glory with Dicers,<note place="margin">Cic.

Suetonius writeth that the only report that Auguſtus vſed ſuch games, redounded great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his reproch: &amp; indeed he was much addicted therto, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teſtifieth by two Epiſtles rehearſed by the ſame author: yea this brute ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of him made him to be reputed among vnthrifts notwithſtanding many great vertues wherewith hee was endued.<note place="margin">Aurel. vict. in the life of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, Sueton. in the life of Claudi.</note> As alſo another author repeating his vices, among the reſt ſayth expreſſely that hee vſed much to play at Dice. Claudius Caeſar, an Emperor of Rome as the ſame Suetonius doth note, witneſſed him ſelfe to be a foole, not only in reſpect of his other vices, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſo gaue himſelfe to Cards &amp; Dice, that he wrote a booke of the Art of play, which bred him great obloquy. How much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſhould we Chriſtians accompt theſe games of chance &amp; hazard to be pernitious, and vtterly to be abhorred.</p>
               <p n="8">8 If any reply that in this caſe we ſhew too much rigour, we will aunſwere with Chriſoſtome: That the cutting off of ſuperfluitie in the life of the faithful,<note place="margin">Chriſoſt. in a Serm. againſt the exceſſe of time.</note> is no bringing of them into too much auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of life. But theſe games are not only ſuperfluous, but alſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; pernitious. Likewiſe albeit we might accompt them among things indiferent, yet ſhould Chriſtian libertie bee ſubiect to ſuch politicke laws as forbid them, and without conſideration hereof, to practiſe the ſame which S.

And it is true, for there is no man whoſoeuer, but both needeth and is bound to amende his life in the premiſes, as alſo in euerie other the dueties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the generall vocation and calling of a Chriſtian.

And therefore ſayth Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Hee that looketh vppon another mannes wife, to lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, hath alreadie committed adulterie with her in his heart.</hi> Next, that wee maye preuent all argument of iealouſie, a moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſe, and of great difficultie to cure. For, as Chriſoſtome ſayeth,<note place="margin">Chriſoſt. vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 2. of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.

               <p n="4">4 Agayne, as marriage was alſo ordained for generation, ſo in that part thereof there are ſome duties that particularly concerne the wife, and ſome that are common both to her and her husband. Of the particular duties of the wife, we will ſpeake heereafter.

For the care and burthen thereof is common: yet ſo, as properly the husband is to get it and to bring it in, and the wife to order and diſpoſe it. Howbeit the dutie of the wife or of the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth not ſo exempt either of them, but that ſhe alſo according to her ability and power muſt help her husband to get it, &amp; he likewiſe in his diſcretion direct hir in the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:18664:143"/> thereof. <hi>Hee that doth not orderly gouerne his houſe,</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall inherite the winde,</hi> ſayth Salomon. And order conſiſteth in this, that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band follow his buſineſſe, traffique, or calling, without anie mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the wife, who ought not to meddle or controll him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but with great diſcretion and gentleneſſe: as alſo the husband is not to deale but ſoberly and in great diſcretion with houſholde affayres that are proper to the wife. The man is iealous of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and reputation, and the woman inclined to ſuſpect her ſelf to be deſpiſed. Wherefore as the husband cannot well abide that his wife ſhould ſhew her ſelfe more skilfull and wife in his buſines than himſelfe: ſo cannot the wife ſuffer that her husband ſhoulde deſpiſe and account her a foole, by medling with her ſmall houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold affayres.</p>
               <p n="5">5 As the dutie therefore of the husband and wife conſiſteth in looking to that which is aforeſayd, to the end their marriage may be quiet, and themſelues liue together in loue: euen ſo an idle and vnthriftie husband, and a prodigall and ſlouthfull wife, are two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die wayes to deſtruction. The husband that hath ſuch a wife, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his labours into a bottomleſſe ſacke: and the wife that is ſped of ſuch a husband, draweth a cart heauie loden, through a ſandie waie without a horſe. Such a husband, eſpecially if idlenes drawe him to loue and haunt tauernes, is cruell to his wife and children: and ſuch a wife confoundeth her husband, and bringeth reproch &amp; pouertie to her whole family. The remedie for the husband that hath ſuch a wife, is patience with ſome ſeueritie, diſcreet admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and prayer to God: as alſo the helpe for the wife that hath ſuch a husband, is tolleration, gentle exhortation, and cheerefull and louing entertainment of her husband, whereby to induce him willingly to keepe home.</p>
               <p n="6">6 They are alſo to be mutuall helpes each to other in matters concerning their own ſaluation and the ſeruice of God. Firſt, if one of them, as ſaith the Apoſtle be an vnbeleeuer, the other muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to drawe his partie to the knowledge of the truth. S. Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the husband &amp; wife of contrarie religions, not to part, but to dwel together: addeth a notable reſon, ſaying:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.16</note> 
                  <hi>What knoweſt thou O man, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy wife, or thou O woman, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy husband?</hi> Therein declaring, that the faithfull perſon in dutie is to labour &amp; indeuor to win his partie to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo to ſaue her.

Yea and at length it falleth out that they depart from their parents to keepe houſe by themſelues. And this plainely appeared in Lea and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell being ſiſters, and the wiues of Iacob. For Iacob grieued at the wronge offered him by their father Laban, boldly made his moane to them: Wherupon they alſo complaining of their father agreed with Iacob, and conſented together to leaue their father, and to follow their husband Iacob.

Otherwiſe it could not be ſaid that there were any marriage betweene two old folkes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Plato of the precepts of mariage.</note>15 The vnion of marriage yet teacheth vs another dutie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to the man and to the wife.

When a woman hath brought great goods, yet may ſhe not ſay, I will doe with mine owne what I liſt: For as Saint Auguſtine ſaith, her ſelfe is not her owne, but her husbands. The husband as the head &amp; chiefe guide of the familie muſt haue the cuſtodie and chiefe gouernment of the goods in the houſe: yet may he diſcharge himſelfe of the whole or of part, as him ſelfe ſhal
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18664:147"/> thinke meete and conuenient. Yet let him remember that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate her, not as a ſeruant, by giuing her money as it were in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, or with condition to returne him a perticular accompt. For the husbands miſtruſt doth many times prouoke the woman: and the wiues vaine expence breedeth miſtruſt in the husband: But the faithfull and diſcreete employment of the wife, and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands confidence in her, will procure that as the goods bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both, ſo each alike ſhall vndertake the cuſtodie and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Hereto for a concluſion wil we yet adde two duties common both to the husband and the wife: The firſt, that they dayly pray to God to giue them grace to liue together in peace and loue, and that each may be a helpe to others ſaluation. Let all ſuch as deſire to enioy ſuch a felicitie, vnderſtand that they muſt dayly pray to God for the obtaining therof: And let thoſe that liue in ſtrife and debate, examine themſelues whether they haue no cauſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their miſerable eſtate to their neglect of this dutie.

               <p>NOw let vs come to the perticular duties, and firſt to the duty of the wife to her husband. As marriage was ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other matters, for generation: ſo together with the duties common both to the husband and to the wife, which thereof doe depend and are before declared, the woman is alſo perticularly called &amp; ſubiect to the bearing of children, to the trauaile of child birth, and to the labour of ſuckling and bringing them vp. This eſtate is full of trouble: yet is ſhe hereto ſubiect by her tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as God ſpeaking to Eue, ſaid: <hi>I will greatly encreaſe thy ſorrows and thy conceptions, in ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children.</hi> But as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18664:148"/> this conſideration ſhould cauſe her to walke in humilitie, as in all her ſorrowes and labour bearing the <hi>Badge of ſinne:</hi> ſo ſhould them the ſame condition and eſtate conceiue comfort, in that, as S. Paul teſtifieth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. <hi>2.</hi>15.</note> 
                  <hi>The woman ſhall be ſaued by bearing of children.</hi> In which bearing of children, the Apoſtle meaneth the heauineſſe, want of reliſh, and other the troubles while ſhe breedeth: the ſorrows and trauaile of child birth: and the labours in nurſing &amp; bringing them vp. And this is the wonderfull wiſedome &amp; goodnes of God: that he laieth a foundation of comfort for the woman in that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe doth breed her ſorrow and care: for theſe fruites of ſinne ſhalbe conuerted to her good and ſaluation. Alſo by obaying qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in this vocation, ſhee doth ſeruice to God, &amp; ſo is ſaued, &amp; led through this meanes and way into euerlaſting life, in caſe as Saint Paule alſo addeth, with modeſtie ſhee abide in faith, loue and ſanctification.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As by this word, generation of children, is alſo ment her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in ſuckling them: ſo is the woman to remember that God hath giuen her two breſts, not that ſhe ſhould employ them for a ſhew or oſtentation, but in the ſeruice of God, and to bee a helpe to her husband, in ſuckling the children common to them both: Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth, that God conuerteth her bloud into the Milke where with the cilde is nurſed in the mothers wombe: Hee bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it into the breſts, furniſhed with Nipples conuenient to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the warme Milke vato the childe, whom he endueth with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie to draw out the Milke for his owne ſuſtenance. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man therefore that can ſuckle her child and doth it not, but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this office and duetie of a mother, declareth her ſelfe to bee very vnthankefull to God, &amp; as it were forſaketh and contemneth the fruite of her wombe. And therefore the brute beaſtes lying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and graunting not one Niple or two, but ſixe or ſeuen to their young ones, ſhall riſe in iudgement againſt theſe daintie halfe mothers, who for feare of wrinkling of their faces, or to auoid ſome ſmall labour, doe refuſe this office of a mother due to their children. They might take example by Anna the mother of Samuell, who ſuckled her child till the daies of weaning: By Sarah the wife of Abraham, as Moſes noteth, where hee attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to her theſe ſpeeches.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Who would haue ſaid to Abraham that Sarah ſhould haue giuen children ſucke?</hi> And for the words of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſaid vnto Ieſus, <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, &amp; the pappes that gaue thee ſucke,</hi> As the firſt part of her ſpeech muſt bee ment by the virgine Marie, ſo may we in reaſon referre to her alſo
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18664:148"/> the ſecond, &amp; thereof gather that ſhe ſuckled her ſon Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But let vs goe on to other the perticuler duties of the wife to her husband. The husband is the head of the wife and the wife is ſubiect to her husband. It is the ordinance of God, grounded,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.13.</note> as Saint Paule noteth, firſt vpon this, that man was created firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 11.8.</note> and afterward Eue: Secondly as the ſame Apoſtle ſayth, in this that the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man: thereto adding that the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man. And therefore it is meete ſhe ſhould bee ſubiect to her husband. Theſe reſons do proue, that the ſubiection of the wife to her husband is it not in her a curſe, for it was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the order and end of her creation, before the tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the third reaſon enſued vpon this: That the woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeduced by the Serpent, ſeduced her husband,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.14,</note> as Saint Paule alſo noteth, ſaying: <hi>Adam was not deceiued,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>but the woman was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and was in the tranſgreſsion.</hi> It was alſo the ſentence which God pronounced, when hee reproued the woman, for that thee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Serpent, had ſeduced her husband. <hi>Thy will,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>ſhall be ſubiect to thy husband, and he ſhall haue dominion ouer thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet. 3.1. Coloſ. <hi>3.</hi>18. Ephe. 5.22.</note> Neither is it without reaſon that this ſubiection of the woman to her husband is ſo often commanded and recommended in Gods word. <hi>Let wiues,</hi> ſaith Saint Peter, <hi>bee ſubiect to their husbandes. Wiues,</hi> ſaith Saint Paul, <hi>be yee ſubiect to your husbands, as it is meete, in the Lord.</hi> Alſo writing to the Epheſians, hee ſaith, <hi>Wiues bee yee ſubiect to your husbands, as to the Lord.</hi>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet <hi>3.</hi>5.</note> 
                  <hi>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church.</hi> Saint Peter the rather to induce them to this dutie, addeth. <hi>For in time past the holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which truſted in God, attired themſelues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.12.</note> 
                  <hi>not in ſumptuous apparell but in vertue, and were ſubiect to their husbands.</hi> And for example he aleaged Sarah the wife of Abraham, who called her husband <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> This ſubiection, in the daies of Saint Paule was acknowledged by the couering of their heads. And in that conſideration doth he ſo earneſtly vpholde that the woman ought to couer her head, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that ſhee is vnder power of her husband. This did Rebecca well vnderſtand and practiſe: for ſeeing her husband Iſaac come,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.65.</note> before ſhe preſented her ſelfe in his preſence, ſhee tooke a Vayle and couered her head, as a token of ſubiection and teſtimonie of the reuerence that ſhe did beare vnto him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The duties of the wife compriſed in this ſubiection,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.24.</note> are by Saint Paule noted, who ſayth: <hi>As the Church is ſubiect to Christ, ſo let women bee ſubiect to their husbandes in all thinges,</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:18664:149"/> As the Church therefore ſhould depend vpon the wiſedome, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note> and will of Chriſt, and not follow what it ſelfe liſteth: So muſt the wife alſo rule and apply her ſelfe to the diſcretion and will of her husband: euen as the gouernment and conduct of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing reſteth in the head, not in the body. Moſes writeth, that the Serpent was wiſe aboue all the beaſts of the field: and that did he declare in aſſaulting the woman, that when he had ſeduced her, ſhe might alſo ſeduce her husband. Saint Paule noting this among other the cauſes of the womans ſubiection, doth ſufficiently ſhew that for the auoiding of the like inconueniences, it is Gods will that ſhee ſhould bee ſubiect to her husband, ſo that ſhe ſhall haue no other diſcretion or will, but what may depend vpon her head: As alſo he ſaith: <hi>Thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thy husband, and he ſhall rule ouer thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note> This dominion ouer the wiues will doth manifeſtly appeare in this, that God in olde time ordained, that if the woman had vowed any thing vnto God, it ſhould notwithſtanding reſt in her husband to diſaduow it: So much is the wiues will ſubiect to her husband.<note place="margin">Numb. 30.7.</note> Yet is it not ment that the wife ſhould not employ her knowledge and diſcretion which God hath giuen her, in the helpe of her husband. But alwaies it muſt bee with condition to ſubmit her ſelfe to him, acknowledging him to bee her head, that finally they may ſo agree in one, as the coniunction of marriage doth require. Yet as when in a Lute or other muſicall inſtrument, two ſtrings concurring in one tune, the ſound neuertheleſſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the ſtrongeſt and higheſt, ſo in a well ordered houſeholde there muſt be a communication and conſent of counſell and will, betweene the husband and the wife, yet ſuch as the counſell and commaundement may reſt in the husband.</p>
               <p n="5">5 True it is, that ſome women are wiſer and more diſcreete then their husbands: As Abigall the wife of Nabal, and others. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Salomon deceiued when he ſaid, <hi>A wiſe woman buildeth vp the houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 14. Prou. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and bleſſed is the man that hath a diſcreet wife:</hi> Yet ſtill a great parte of the diſcretion of ſuch women ſhall reſt in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their husbands to be their heads, and ſo vſing the graces that they haue receiued of the Lord, that their husbands may bee honoured, not contemned, neither of them nor of others, which falleth out contrarie when the wife will ſeeme wiſer then her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.<note place="margin">Plut. of the precepts of matrimonie.</note> A certaine heathen Philoſopher hath very well deſcribed this modeſtie and dutie of a wife, ſaying: That a woman ſhould not ſpeake but to her husband, or by her husband. And as the voyce of him that ſoundeth a trumpet is not ſo lowd as the ſound that it
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18664:149"/> yeeldeth: ſo is the wiſedome and word of a woman of greater ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacie, when all that ſhe knoweth and can doe, is as if it were ſaid and done by her husband.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The obedience that the wife oweth to her husband, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon this ſubiection of her will and wiſedome vnto him.<note place="margin">1. Pet. <hi>3.</hi>6.</note> As S. Peter alſo noteth in Sarah the wife of Abraham: For hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted Chriſtian women to be ſubiect to their husbands, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the example of Sarah, ſaying: <hi>As Sarah obeyed Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and called him Lord.</hi> And in that ſence ſaith S. Paul,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the wife ſtand in awe of her husband:</hi> For fearing to diſpleaſe her husband,<note place="margin">Eſter. 1.</note> ſhe will be carefull to yeelde vnto him due obedience. Vpon Queene Vaſhties refuſall to obey her husband, King Aſſuerus, hee tooke occaſion to forſake her, and to depriue her of that great eſtate to be Queene ouer many kingdomes. For albeit ſhe might ſeeme in reaſon not to pleaſe him in that hee required of her: yet had it beene better for her to haue pleaſed him, in a matter of it ſelfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not wicked, then by her refuſall to prouoke her husband, and giue him cauſe to ſuſpect ſome diſdaine and contempt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering, ſhee might well thinke that the King coulde not paciently beare ſuch a refuſall in ſo ſolemne an aſſemblie. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are women taught not to prouoke their husbands by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in matters that may bee performed without offence to God: neither to preſume ouer them either in kindred or wealth: or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately to refuſe in matter that may trouble houſeholde peace and quiet. Diſobedience begetteth contempt of the husband:<note place="margin">Heſt. 1.12.</note> and contempt wrath, as we may note in this hiſtorie of Heſter, and is manie times the cauſe of troubles betweene the man and the wife. If the obedience importeth any difficultie, ſhe may for her excuſe gently propound the ſame, yet vpon condition to obey in caſe the husband ſhoulde perſiſt in his intent, ſo long as the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie importeth no wickedneſſe. For it is better to continue peace by obedience, then to breake it by reſiſtaunce. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it is naturall in the members to obey the conduct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the head. Yet muſt not this obedience ſo far extend as that the husband ſhould commande any thing contrarie to her honor and ſaluation, and in this ſence wee muſt take the ſaying of Saint Paule: <hi>Wiues, bee ſubiect to your husbands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.18. Ephe. 5, <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as it is comelie in the Lorde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Many women do thinke this ſubiection and obedience a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed matter vnworthie them:<note place="margin">1. Tim. <hi>2.</hi>13.</note> But let them remember that there was no curſe or indignitie in the woman that was created with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18664:150"/> after the Image of God:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 11.8.</note> Yet did the order of the creation of Adam being the firſt created, and Eue the next: Likewiſe the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of woman from out of man, ſubmit Eue to Adam, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the wife to the husband, as is aforeſaid. But as concerning the third reaſon of this ſubiection, namely that when the Serpent had ſeduced her,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.14.</note> ſhe alſo ſeduced her husband: ſhe is in the ſcarre or blemiſh of that her ſinne to acknowledge the mercy, goodneſſe and wiſedome of God. For as for the benefite of the perſon, God hath put the body in ſubiection to the head, that thereby it may be guided and gouerned: So the frailtie of the woman ſeduced by the Serpent, together with her boldeneſſe to ſeduce her husband, did ſtand in need of this remedy of ſubiection, whereby as wel ſhe ſhould haue no authoritie to receiue any ſo pernitious counſels, as alſo her husband ſhould haue no excuſe, in caſe he would be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to wickedneſſe by her that was ſubiect vnto him. As therefore it were a monſterus matter, and the meanes to ouerthrow the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the bodie ſhould, in refuſing all ſubiection and obedience to the head, take vpon it to guide it ſelf &amp; to commaund the head ſo were it for the wife to rebell againſt the husband. Let her then beware of diſordering and peruerting the courſe which God in his wiſedome hath eſtabliſhed, and with all let her vnderſtand, that going about it, ſhee riſeth not ſo much againſt her husband as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: And that it is her good and honor to obey God in her ſubiection and obedience to her husband. If in the practiſe of this dutie ſhe find any difficultie or trouble, through the inconſiderate courſe of her husband, or otherwiſe, let her remember that the ſame proceedeth not of the order eſtabliſhed by the Lorde, but through ſome ſinne afterward creept in, which hath mixed gale among the home of the ſubiection &amp; obedience that the woman ſhould haue enioyed in that eſtate wherein together with Adam ſhe was created after the Image of God. And ſo let her humble her ſelfe in the ſight of God, and bee well aſſured, that her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection and obedience is acceptable vnto him. Likewiſe that the more that the Image of God is reſtored in her and her husband through the regeneration of the holy Ghoſt, the leſſe difficultie ſhall ſhe finde in that ſubiection and obedience, as many in their marriage haue indeede tried to their great contentment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Some other duties ther be that particularly belong to women: As firſt a certaine diſcretion and deſire required at their handes, to pleaſe the nature, inclination and maners of their husbands, ſo
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18664:150"/> long as the ſame import no wickedneſſe. For as the looking glaſſe how ſoeuer faire and beautifully adorned, is nothing worth if it ſhew that countenaunce ſad which is pleaſaunt,<note place="margin">Eraſ. Apotheg lib. 3.</note> or the ſame plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant that is ſad: So the woman deſerueth no commendation, that (as it were) contrarying her husband, when hee is merie, ſheweth her ſelfe ſad, or in his ſadnes vttereth her mirth. And hereto may we referre the old ſaying of Socrates: Men ſhould obey the lawes of their Citties, and women the maners of their husbands.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Moreouer a modeſt and chaſt woman that loueth her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, muſt alſo loue her houſe, as remembring that the husband that loueth his wife cannot ſo well like of the ſight of any Tapiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as to ſee his wife in his houſe.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.<hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> And Saint Paule willeth the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient women to teach the yonger ſort among other things, to bee chaſt, to loue their husbands, and to keepe the houſe.<note place="margin">Plut. in the precepts of marriage.</note> In this ſence did our aunceſters repreſent a woman by a Torteyſe, who neuer goeth out of her ſhell. The woman that gaddeth from houſe to houſe to prate, confoundeth her ſelfe, her husband and her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. But there are fower ſeaſons wherein the woman is to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. The firſt, to come to holy meetings according to the duty of pietie: The ſecond to viſit ſuch as ſtand in neede, as the dutie of loue and charitie doe require: The third for employment in houſhold affaires committed to her charge. The laſt, with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band when he ſhall require her. As alſo Abimelech king of Gerar, reprouing Sarah becauſe ſhe had as it were abandoned her ſelfe, in that ſhee confeſſed not that Abraham was her husband,<note place="margin">Gen. 20.16.</note> ſaid vnto her, <hi>Thy husband is the vayle of thine eyes to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 The wife alſo is in dutie to bee content to pleaſe her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and not to bee curious or giuen to adorning of her bodie or ſumptuouſneſſe in apparell: Which vanitie muſt of neceſsitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede either of ambition and pride, or of ſome diſordinate deſire to content others, rather then her husband. And therefore it will better like him, and bee more ſeemely and fit for her to vſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie heerein, eſpeciall conſidering that ſuch curioſitie and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is accompanied with great expence, yea and in ſome with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of laſciuiouſnes. And therfore Saint Paul admoniſheth women to aray themſelues in ſeemely and honeſt apparel with ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; modeſty, &amp; not in brayded haire, gold, pearle,<note place="margin">1.

And the rather to correct this corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being too co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among women, he exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be adorned with good works,<note place="margin">1.

Firſt he is to vnderſtand, that albeit he be ordained to be her head, yet muſt hee not tyrannize and torment her at his pleaſure: for ſuch husbands are monſters in nature. The creation of man doth ſufficiently ſhew that al that is in the head, as reaſon, wiſedome, iudgement, ſight, hearing, and other the giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, do tend to the conduct and happie guiding of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: not to torment and caſt it downe.

                  <hi>As Ieſus Christ is the head of the Church: Euen ſo is the husbande the head of the wife.</hi> And how? He is, ſaith he, the Sauiour of her body. And thereof he taketh this exhortation. <hi>Husbands loue your wiues: euen as Ieſus Chriſt loued his Church, and gaue himſelfe for it: That hee might ſanctifie and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water through the word. That he might make it a glorious Church, not hauing ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing but that it ſhould bee holy and without blame: So ought men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies. He that loueth his wife, loueth himſelfe: for no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord doth the Church.</hi> It is therefore the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the husband ſo to loue his wife, that after the example of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, hee labour not ſo hartely for any thing as to ſet his wife free from trouble and calamitie, and to make her partaker in al his goodes and honor.

Paule alſo noteth, ſaying, <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands loue your wiues, and bee not bitter vnto them.</hi> To the ſame ende alſo doth the admonition of S. Peter vnto husbands tend, where he ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet <hi>3.</hi>7.</note> 
                  <hi>Husbands dwell with your wiues as men of knowledge, giuing honor vnto the woman as to the weaker veſſell, euen as they which are heires together of the grace of life, that your praiers bee not interrupted.</hi> This is a notable exhortation of S. Peter: For by exhorting hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to behaue themſelues diſcreetly, and with knowledge and wiſedome toward their wiues, hee requireth of them two thinges: Firſt, that they neuer ſay nor doe any thing that may iuſtly offend their wiues: as ſome there be, who being prodigal, great ſpenders, or Idle and ſlacke in their buſineſſe, doe cauſe their wiues &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to languiſh in pouertie: Others, who haunting tauernes, doo conſume that which ſhould maintaine their familie: Others, who coming home drunke, doe beate and vexe their wiues, and as it were driue them into diſpaire. Others, who by high and bitter ſpeeches, by threatning and other actions, vnworthy a husband, doe prouoke their wiues, and ſo ſtirre vp ſuch ſtrife and debate, as doe conuert the felicitie of marriage into an hell. Sith therefore that the husband is head, he ought in ſuch wiſedome, reaſon and diſcreation to beare himſelfe, that he giue his wife no iuſt occaſion of offence or prouocation: yea he muſt remember that if the head be drunk, the whole body is in danger of weake gouernment, euen of lying in the myre. Secondly, that albeit the wife ſhould mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter iuſt cauſe of griefe &amp; diſpleaſure, yet that the husband ſhould not thereof take occaſion againſt his wiues infirmities, or enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bitternes, taunts or trouble: but diſcreetly and patiently beare with her, that ſo they might quietly and louingly liue together.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The hurt or weakeneſſe of any one member of the body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh not the head to wrath or bitternes: but rather to compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and an inclination to help it. And indeed whereas God, hauing created woman the weaker veſſell, as S. Peter noteth, did ſo ioyne her to man, it was not to the end that he ſtriuing with ſo frail a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhuld bruſe &amp; breake it: But that by gentle &amp; diſcreete entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he ſhould quietly enioy the helpe that God hath giuen him. Let him therefore after the counſell of S. Peter ſo reſpect her, as one who albeit ſhe be weake, is neuertheles a profitable veſſel for him, as God himſelfe in the creation of the woman hath pronounced,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet. 3.7. Gen. 2.18.</note> ſaying. <hi>I will make him a helper.</hi> Moreouer let him loue and honor
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18664:152"/> her, as one whom notwithanding the frailty of her ſex, God hath ſo honored &amp; Ieſus Chriſt ſo loued, that being together with man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with his bloud, ſhe is together with her husband coheyre of life euerlaſting. A Chriſtal glaſſe is a precious &amp; profitable veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, yet brittle: euen ſo is the maried woman. For albeit ſhe be brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet is ſhe profitable to her husband, &amp; precious in the ſight of God, as a child of God &amp; member of Chriſt. As therefore a man doth more carefully take heede of breaking ſuch a glaſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome earthen or tinne veſſel, the one being more baſe &amp; the other more ſtrong: ſo ſhould the husband haue ſuch regard of the frailty of his wife, that he may beare with her, &amp; entreate her with gentlenes &amp; diſcretion, that he may vſe her as a precious &amp; profitable veſſel, to his comfort &amp; ioy. And in as much as praier is an excellent ſeruice that God requireth of vs, &amp; the redy meanes to purchace his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, let the husband diſcreetly beare with his wife,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.7.</note> leaſt otherwiſe through their ſtrife and contention their praiers, as S. Peter ſaith, might be letted and interrupted.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Yet muſt we not ſay, but the husband both may, and ought to tel his wife of her infirmities, that ſhe may amend: But here we are to enter into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of ſundry points. Firſt he is eſpecially to proue her offences againſt God: As when Rachell ſaid vnto Iacob, <hi>Giue me children, or els I die:</hi> He reproued her of importunitie,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.1.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Am I in Gods ſtead, who hath withholden from thee the fruit of thy womb?</hi> Alſo when Iobs wife ſaid to her husband:<note place="margin">Iob. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Doeſt thou abide in thy integritie? Curſe God and die,</hi> hee wiſely reproued ſuch a wicked ſpeech, ſaying: <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as an vnwiſe woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What? ſhall we receiue good at the hand of God, &amp; not receiue euil?</hi> Secondly, that it be with gentlenes &amp; teſtimonie of good wil, as Helcana delt with his wife Anna, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe mourned becauſe ſhe had no children.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.</note> And indeed it is meet that the husband ſhould reproue his wife louingly, rather by perſwaſion then by force. For as in a great ſtormie winde a man lappeth his cloke about him &amp; holdeth it faſt for feare of looſing: but when the winde is downe and the wether calme, he letteth it hang eaſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo when husbands will as it were perforce wreſt awaie their wiues infirnities, manye of them will obſtinately reſiſt, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe by ſweete words &amp; louing exhortations they might be wonne voluntarily to forſake them. Thirdly, the husband muſt ſeeke diligently to remoue the ſtone wherat his wife ſtumbleth &amp; taketh occaſion of grief. So when Sarah was moued againſt Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, becauſe of Agar, &amp; obiected vnto him, albeit wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully,<note place="margin">Gen. 16.</note> that he was the cauſe that ſhe contemned her, bearing with his wife, he
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18664:153"/> remoued the cauſe of the contention, in ſuffering her to turne A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar out of doores. He muſt alſo take heed that himſelf be not tayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſame vice which hee reproueth in his wife, leaſt ſhee ſtoppe his mouth with the reproch of the ſame fault: But rather by giuing her example by the contrarie vertue, let her be induced to imitate him. In reprouing the wife, the husband muſt alwaies vſe ſuch diſcretion, that ſhe bee not brought into contempt: and therefore it ſhould neuer bee doone in the preſence of more then themſelues. For as it is meere follie for a husband to praiſe and commend his wife in companie: ſo is it as daungerous to checke and reproue her before witneſſe. For indeede thereof it commeth that women, being not able to beare that diſgrace, will replie, and ſo prouoke ſtrife and diſſention in open preſence, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to great reproch and offence. And therefore doth Cleobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus of Lyndie, one of the wiſemen of Greece, deliuer theſe two precepts to the married man: Firſt, that he flatter not his wife: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that hee reproue her not before ſtraungers. And Marcus Aurelius vſeth three, ſaying: A wiſe husband, and one that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to liue in quiet with his wife, muſt obſerue theſe three rules: Often to admoniſh: Seeldome to reproue, and neuer to ſmite her: Let the husband alſo remember the ſayinges of a heathen, who ſpeaking of the infirmities of the woman, very aptly ſaith, That they muſt bee either taken away, or borne withall. Hee that can take them quite away, maketh the woman farre more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fit for his purpoſe: and hee that can beare with them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe better and more vertuous.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The husband is alſo to vnderſtand, that as God created the woman, not of the head, and ſo equall in authoritie with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſo alſo he created her not of Adams foote, that ſhee ſhould bee troden downe and deſpiſed, but hee tooke her out of the ribbe, that ſhee might walke ioyntly with him vnder the conduct and gouernment of her head. And in that reſpect the husband is not to commaund his wife in manner as the maſter his ſeruaunt, but as the ſoule doth the body, as being conioyned in like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good will. For as the ſoule in gouerning the bodie, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the benefite and commoditie of the ſame, ſo ought the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion &amp; commaundement of the husband ouer his wife, to tend to reioyce and content her.</p>
               <p n="6">6 To conclude. As God hath teſtified his ſingular goodnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man in creating him an helper to aſsiſt him: ſo let him conſider
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18664:153"/> in how many ſortes ſhee is to him a helper to paſſe ouer this lyfe in bleſſedneſſe. And let this dayly ſeeking of ſuch a benefite, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the hand of God, induce him to render thankes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe to vſe it well to his owne comfort and ſaluation, and not to abuſe it to the deſtruction both of himſelf and his wife. But if hee chaunceth (as many do) vpon troubles &amp; afflictions in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, let him remember that the ſame doo proceed, not properly from marriage, but from the corruptions of the parties marryed, and for his parte let him ſtudie to amend his infirmities and faults, by amendement of lyfe, and withall, praie to God to grant the like grace vnto his wiſe: to the ende, that the more they recouer the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, the more feeling they maye haue of the felicitie of marryage, which Adam and Eue had inioyed, had they continued as they were created, in the image of God.</p>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18664:154"/> wee can ſee, that mothers ſwathing theyr little ones, doo laie theyr limmes right, each in his place: likewiſe if a child be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to bee left handed, they chide him, yea, ſometimes they binde it vp, or otherwiſe reſtraine the vſe of it, that hee may bee accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the right. Alſo if the childe hath ſome ſtring vnder his tongue, they cut it, leaſt it ſhoulde hinder his ſpeech: much rather then ought they to beware, that by theyr inconuenience the vices of the ſoule doo not increaſe: for it is the dutie of parents euen in the infancie, to beginne to ſhape and frame the ſoule vnto vertue.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is alſo the dutie of parents, to prouide that theyr children maye learne to write and reade, for it maye bee vnto them a great helpe in the courſe of this life, and a treaſure of greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than money. And therfore the negligence of many is ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee reproued. Beſides that, the peformance of the dueties of parents heerein, doth greatly binde theyr children vnto them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, the principall end thereof ſhoulde not haue reſpect to ſuch commoditie as the children may reape thereby towardes the vſe of this preſent life, but rather that they may reade the word of God to theyr comfort and inſtruction to ſaluation. As alſo it were theyr partes to vſe them dayly to reade ſome Chapters of the holy Scriptures, thereby to incline theyr affections to the word of God: to inure them in the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt, by lyttle and lyttle to learne the heauenly doctrine, to note the examples of Gods vengeance poured vpon the wicked and diſobedient: and of his bleſsinges vnto thoſe that walke in his feare. Athanaſius to this purpoſe ſayth verie well, If thou lookeſt that thy children ſhoulde obey thee,<note place="margin">Athan. vpon the 6. to the Ephe.</note> ioyne and accuſtome them to Gods woorde, it wyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound greatlye to thy profyte.

But it is not ſo when they are inſtructed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Parents therefore are diligently to applie themſelues to this which God commandeth, and ſo often and earneſtly commendeth vnto them, namely, to inſtruct theyr children in the knowledge &amp; feare of God,<note place="margin">Plut. in his Lacon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theg.</note> and in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18664:154"/> they grow in yeres they will contemne and forget.

               <p n="23">23 It is alſo the dutie of parents to maintaine their children in peace, concord, and amitie. For if diſcord &amp; contention be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pernitious among all men, how much rather between bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren &amp; ſiſters? Likewiſe if it be hard quenching of ſtomacke and debate betweene thoſe that are not conioyned in kindred, it is far more difficult to reunite brethren, becauſe enmitie among them is mightie and ſtrong like yron bars to keepe them aſunder. Neither is there anie thing more ſlipperie or of greater efficacie to ſubuert a family, than diſſention among brethren. It is an olde ſaying,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his Apotheg:</note> 
                  <hi>By</hi> concord ſmall things do grow, but by diſcord great things come to nought. And this is ſooneſt found among brethren. Scilurus, who had fourſcore children, to induce them to liue together in peace &amp;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18664:160"/> concord, did verie aptly repreſent vnto them the truth of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thus: He toke a ſheafe of many arrowes, &amp; offered it to each of his children one after another, willing them to break it, but they could not. Then pulling forth the arrowes one by one, they brake them all. Euen thus, ſayd their father, is it with you, for ſo long as you remaine vnited and loue each other, no man can hurt or break you, but if once ye fall at iarre and ſtrife, euery man will deſtroy &amp; ouerthrow you. This duetie of parents to keepe their children in peace &amp; louing concord, did the Lacedemonians well vnderſtand. For when on a time two brethren fell at ſtrife and contention,<note place="margin">Plut. in his Lacon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theg.</note> they puniſhed both the father and mother, becauſe by good inſtruction they had not preuented, or at the leaſt, preſently appeaſed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention betweene their children.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Againe, how dangerous it is for parents to ſhew more loue &amp; affection to one child than to another, except vpon great and iuſt cauſe, the example of Iacobs childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth teſtifie. For what was the originall of their enuie and crueltie executed againſt their brother Ioſeph? Moſes ſaith, that Iacob louing Ioſeph better than his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.3.</note> made him a partie coloured coate, &amp; thereof they tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to hate him, and to ſpeake roughly vnto him. Parents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end to preuent like inconueniences, are to vſe equalitie among theyr children ſo neere as may be, whether in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vſage, or in the diuiſion of their goods. For as all men naturally are inclined but too much to the loue of earthly goods, ſo the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal ſharing of the ſame, doth oftentimes breed great braules and pernitious debate betweene brethren.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Moreouer, as children grow toward the ſtate of matrimony, it is meet that theyr parents ſhould reſtrain them from all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie whereby they might be allured to the ſinne of fornication: For beſides the hainouſnes of the offence againſt God, the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof depending are for the moſt parte verie pernitions.

And therefore to conclude this ſpeech, we may wel ſay, it is better to match our children with Chriſtian &amp; vertuous heads that haue litle monie, than with much treaſure in the poſſeſsion of worldly and vicious heads.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Heereto will we yet adde two points concerning the duties of parents to their children: firſt, that in all their wordes &amp; workes they be vnto them continuall examples and myrrors of pietie and vertue: ſo ſhall their admonitions &amp; exhortations be ſtill of greater efficacie, and themſelues ſhall haue more authoritie to reproue, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, &amp; chaſtiſe their children. And in deed, the ſame that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius ſaith, that to make children vertuous, they ſhall more profit by good example in one month, than by inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a whole yere, may be moſt truely applied vnto parents. He that teacheth
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18664:161"/> a childe to write may ſometime ſaye, yee muſt make this letter long, this ſhort, this ſtraight &amp;c. But the chiefe meanes to make him to profit in writing, is to ſet him good examples or coppies &amp; to write before him. And ſo is it in the inſtruction of vertue and the feare of God. For contrariwiſe, he that teacheth well, and liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euil, buildeth with one hand and pulleth downe with another. And experience teacheth that more may be pulled downe in one hower, then will be built vp in one day. The euill example of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is as a line to draw the children to follow them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet Ezechiell reprouing the people of his time for their Idolatrie, and other corruptions, declareth that therin they haue taken the ordinarie courſe, that is,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16, 42.</note> they haue followed the example of their parents. <hi>Behold</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all that vſe prouerbs, ſhall vſe this prouerbe againſt thee, ſaying, like mother, like daughter: Thou art thy mothers daughter that hath caſt off her hushand and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thou art the ſiſter of thy ſiſters, which forſooke their husbands and their children, your mother is an Hittite, and your father an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morite.</hi> Here are three olde prouerbes, which proue that children ordinarily are ready to imitate the bad examples of their parents.

The ſame did the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Marcus Aurelius (who aboue all men, was careful to bring vp his children in vertue) obiect to his wife: for ſpeaking to her of the inſtruction of her daughters, hee ſaid: What will it auaile for her miſtres to teach her honeſtie and modeſtie, when our ſelues in our workes doe inuite her to wantonneſſe?</p>
               <p n="29">29 Verball inſtruction, without example of good deedes, is a dead doctrine: and contrariwiſe, good examples are the life of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to make it profitable and effectuall.

What accompt can thoſe fathers giue vnto God, who by their euill example haue drawne into hel their children whom he deliuered to their charge to be guided into heauen?

And this dutrie let them begin to performe, euen ſo ſoone as they are in hope of generation, by praying to God to preſerue it, to giue to the mother happy deliuerance of her fruite, and ſo to diſpoſe, that the child may receiue the ſeale of ſaluation by Baptiſme, &amp; grace to bring forth fruites to Gods glory. Let them remember that the praier of the whole Church for their children in their Baptiſme, is a warning of their bounden dutie dayly to do the like for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be admitted into the couenant by Baptiſme.<note place="margin">Iob. 1.5.</note> In this point let them remember the care of Iob for his children that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready growne and come to age, not only in that he dayly ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to ſanctifie them, by admoniſhing them of ſuch infirmities as they might peraduenture haue committed in banqueting, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it modeſtly and ſoberly together: But alſo in that he dayly roſe vp earely and offered ſacrifice for them according to their number, ſaying to himſelfe, <hi>It may be, my ſonnes haue ſinned and blaſphemed God in their harts.</hi> Wherein hee giueth vnto parents two notable leſſons: One, that if the children doe ſinne, the parents are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether themſelues may not be guiltie in the ſight of God, as not hauing ſufficiently performed their duties in teaching, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, giuing good example, &amp; praying to God for them: The other that they ought to haue ſuch a care of the ſaluation of their children, that albeit they haue not committed any notable &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſinne, yet preſuppoſing that according to mans frailtie, they liue not without offending God, after the example of Iob, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſacrifice to God for his children, and that no doubt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were accompanied with hartie praier for them, they muſt pray for their children, that their ſinnes may bee forgiuen them through the onely ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="31">31 To conclude. As S. Paule tearmeth the family of Philemon,<note place="margin">Philem. ver. 2. Rom. 16.5.

               <head>Of the dutie of children to their parents. Chap. <hi>5.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw let vs come to the duties of children to their parents. And theſe doth God comprehend in the fifth commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the lawe, in theſe words: <hi>Honor thy father and thy mother.</hi> And this commaundement is the more to bee noted, becauſe it is often repeated in the holy Scripture. Now by this word <hi>Honor,</hi> is ſignified the loue, reuerence, dutie, obedience, ſubiection, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and neceſſarie aſsiſtance that children owe to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. As concerning the loue, the ſummarie of the ſecond Table comprehended in theſe wordes: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> doe manifeſtly confirme it. For who can bee a neerer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the children to loue, then the parents? Beſides that, they are not to be loued onely as neighbours proceeding of Adam and Eue, but alſo as fathers and mothers. And therefore what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is it, not to loue thoſe of whom, next after God, they haue their life and being together with many great and continuall benefites toward them. Alſo the loue that parents doe beare to their children, beſides ſo many their labours, ſorrowes, troubles and vexations, ſhould binde them reciprocally to loue them. The ſunne ſhining a while vpon the colde ſtones, doth ſo heate them that they yeelde ſome warmth: ſo albeit that children be as hard and colde as ſtones, yet the experience, and the dayly feeling of the loue of their parents towards them, ought mightily to enflame their hartes to loue them againe. Take away the beame from the ſunne, ſaid a good old father, and it wil not ſhine: the ſprings from the riuer and it will drie vp: the bough from the tree, and it will wither: the member from the body &amp; it will rot: And ſo take from children their dutie to their parents, and they are no longer chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but brethren and companions with thoſe vnto whom Ieſus Chriſt ſaid. <hi>Yee are the children of the Deuill.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Plut. in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotheg. of the Grecians.</note>2 This loue ought eſpecially to appeare in a certain care, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſire to reioyce and content our parents. For as we reade to this purpoſe, &amp; Epaminondas ſaid, that of all the good and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie that euer happened him, he neuer ſo much delighted in any, as in his victorie ouer the Lacedemonians at Leuctria, where he wonne the fielde, while his father and mother yet liued. Such was his loue to them, that his ſingular contentation conſiſted in the pleaſure that they would conceiue in the victorie of their ſonne.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18664:163"/> And that this his contentment conſiſted onely in his loue to his parents and not in couetize of vaine-glorie, we may gather by his commendations publiſhed by Iuſtin, who ſaith,<note place="margin">Iuſtin. lib. 6.</note> that it was a hard choiſe to diſcerne whether hee were an honeſter man or a better Captaine: That in the exerciſe of any publike office, hee neuer ſought himſelfe, but the good of his countrie: That he was not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous either of glorie or of money. Theſe are notable commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in a heathen Captaine: God graunt that Chriſtians may follow him and deſerue the like. His example doth declare that children ought ſo to loue their parents, that their affection may tend to liue vertuouſly, euen to reioyce them: and to eſchue euill, leaſt they ſhould grieue them.<note place="margin">Prou. 10.1.</note> And this is it that Salomon admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, ſaying. <hi>A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father, but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.</hi> Againe. <hi>A fooliſh ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and an heauineſſe to her that bare him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 17.25.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 This band of loue of parents ſhould take place, not onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch as are gentle and louing, but alſo (as Saint Peter ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.18.</note> of the duties of ſeruants to their maſters) euen toward ſuch as bee rigorous. For if wee ought to loue all the children of Adam: euen thoſe whome wee know not, or our enemies and perſecutors, how much rather our parents, albeit they ſhould intreate vs roughly &amp; with rigour either in word or deede? And indeede the principal cauſe ſtill abideth, namely that they bee our father and mother. This ought children well to note, to the ende that patiently bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their reprehenſions, reproofes, and in generall, whatſoeuer their troubleſome and ſharpe affections, they may ſtill continue and declare their childe-like affection and loue. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe remember, the labour, greefe, anguiſh, weeping, ſorrow and other troubleſome cares that parentes doe abide for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This loue muſt be accompanied with reuerence and reſpect: And to ſay the truth,<note place="margin">Mat, 23.2.</note> albeit the name of father belongeth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God, as Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>You haue but one father, euen him that is in heauen.</hi> Yet doth hee ſo impart it to thoſe that haue begotten vs, that they being called fathers, doe beare the title and Image of God. And this is it that bindeth children to reſpect and honor them, and to teſtifie the ſame by their outwarde reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The Lacedemonians did ſo carefully accuſtome their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hereto, that we reade of a good perſonage who had ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to parents,<note place="margin">Plu. in his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. Apotheg.</note> that being demaunded wherfore at Sparta the young men did riſe vp when their elders came in place, hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18664:164"/> To the ende that by honoring age they may learne and accuſtome themſelues to reuerence their parentes. Of this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we haue a notable example in Salomon:<note place="margin">1. King. 2.19.</note> He vnderſtanding that his mother Bathſeeba was comming to ſpeake with him, aroſe from his ſeat, came to meet her, bowed before her, and ſet her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his right hand. Neither could his greatneſſe, neither his Royal eſtate priuiledge him from this reſpect and honor due to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To this purpoſe we alſo reade a notable hiſtorie, which may ſerue for an expoſition of this matter. As a certaine gouernour of Creet came with his father to the Philoſopher Taurus, finding there but one ſtoole readie,<note place="margin">Aul. Gellius. lib. 2. c. 2.</note> the father woulde haue had his ſonne (as a Romaine Magiſtrate) to ſit down, but the Philoſopher willed him as the father to ſit downe and calling for another ſeate for the ſonne, ſaid. When the ſonne doth execute his magiſtracie, or publike office, hee is greater then his father, and muſt beare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a Magiſtrate, not as a ſonne: But when he is out of place or execution of his office, he muſt, how highly ſoeuer he be aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, haue a reſpect and yeelde reuerence to his father. But many times it falleth out otherwiſe: For many children when they come to honor or wealth, doe ſo deſpiſe their parentes, if they bee of meaner calling then themſelues, that hardly they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or call them father as if they were aſhamed of them. Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the ſonne of the Romaine Emperour Decius,<note place="margin">Valer. Max. l. 4</note> moſt liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented mans inclination to this vice, and ſought in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to preuent it. For when his father on a time ſaide that hee would inueſt his ſonne in the Diademe Imperiall, his ſonne refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, ſaying: I feare leaſt being Emperour, I forget that I am a ſonne. Rather will I continue an obedient ſonne, then being an Emperour to neglect and forget the due honour that the ſonne oweth to his Father. Let my father commaunde, and let my Empire conſiſt in my due obedience to him. For that man putteth off the affection of a childe to his father, who by the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of an office ouer him quencheth the name of a ſonne. Salomon forgat not himſelfe in this kinde of dutie, for hee did not onely bow before his mother Bathſeeba, as is aforeſaide, but alſo called her mother ſaying.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> King 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Mother aske and I will not denie thee.</hi> And this doe we the rather note alſo vpon another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, namely that his example condemneth the cuſtome of theſe daies, wherein this name of father and mother is accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo baſe and comtemptible, that the children of Kinges, Princes, yea euen of meane Gentlemen, ſpeaking to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18664:164"/> muſt not ſay father, mother, but Sir, my Lorde, my Ladye, Madam. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But the due honor to parents that we here ſpeake of, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not onely this outwarde reuerence, but alſo that wee ſhoulde ſo eſteeme of them as that neither our ſelues ſhould diſpiſe them, neither ſhoulde wee ſuffer others to haue them in contempt.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.49. Telecrus. Plut. in his Lacon. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theg,</note> And this are we to vnderſtand in the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>I honor my father but you diſhonour mee.</hi> Hee there defendeth the honor of his father againſt the falſe opinions and ſlaunders of the Iewes. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lacedemonian in olde time did truely performe this dutie of a childe. For when one tolde him that his father ſpake hardly of him, he aunſwered,<note place="margin">Stobeus Scr. 177.</note> that he would not doe it if he had not good cauſe: Thus hee chooſe rather to beare the blame himſelfe, then his father ſhoulde. In this ſence, when an other was readie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his father in iudgement, did one Pittacus reprooue him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if thou preferreſt a bad cauſe, thou ſhalt bee condemned: Likewiſe if the cauſe be right, thou alſo ſhalt bee condemned for procuring thy fathers condemnation. This alſo in this caſe is to bee noted, that amonge the Romaines the childe was not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſue the will or teſtament of his deade father by action, but by petition onely, wherein hee ſhoulde ſpeake of him with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, honour and reuerence, and referre his caſe wholy to the diſcretion and conſciences of the iudges. Thus ought children to honour and reſpecte theyr parentes.<note place="margin">Bodin in his firſt booke of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This iniquitie is ſo abhominable in the ſight of God, that hee pronounceth <hi>Woe</hi> vnto thoſe children that curſe theyr father or mother. Yea hee
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:18664:165"/> ordaineth that they ſhould bee put to death, as alſo all ſuch as in action ſhall iniurie their parents by ſmiting either with ſtaffe or fiſt &amp;c. And to cut off all replication, as if death were to hard and rigorous a puniſhment, eſpecially in caſe there were no hurt or wound,<note place="margin">Leuit. 20.9</note> he confirmeth the former iudgement with this addition: <hi>Becauſe he hath curſed his father or mother, his bloud ſhall bee vpon his owne head.</hi> And indeede ſuch children as either in word or deede ſhall iniurie father or mother: euen thoſe I ſay of whom they haue taken life: who beare the Image of God, and the title of father, proper to God: ſo that God is in them iniuried and condemned, are monſters in nature. In this reſpect among other the cauſes why the children of Iſrael were ſo hardly entreated by Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,<note place="margin">Ezech. 22.7</note> &amp; led captiue into Babilon, the Prophet Ezechiel obiecteth vnto them, that they diſpiſed and contemned their parents. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides by experience we ſee that vſually thoſe children that iniurie their parents, are afterward as hardly intreated by their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:<note place="margin">Eraſ Apotheg lib. 8.</note> And the knowledge of this iuſt vengeance is naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the hart of man: as we reade of a wicked childe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed that he had ſmitten his father, anſwered: And he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did ſmite his father, and this lad (pointing to his owne ſonne) when he groweth bigger, will alſo ſmite and wrong me. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Laert. lib. 1. c. 1</note> as Thales the Mileſian ſaid: As children doe intreate their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſo will their children entreate them. Therefore it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme children to ſuffer their parents rather to treade them vnder their feete, then ſo furiouſly to riſe againſt them. And to that ende let them acknowledge this Image of God, and remember what their parents haue done for them, that deteſting ſuch enormities of curſing or ſmiting their parents as is aforeſaid, they contrariwiſe may beare them reuerence, reſpect and honor in heart and minde both in word and deede.</p>
               <p n="7">7 This commaundement of honoring our parents comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo ſubiection and obedience, as Saint Paule plainely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, ſaying, <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lorde: for this is right.</hi>

But moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of al was the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Who</hi> as S. Paul ſaith <hi>being in the forme of God, thought it no robberie to bee equall with God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>yet made himſelfe of no reputation, &amp; took on him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto man &amp; was found in ſhape as a man: He humbled himſelfe &amp; became obedient vnto death, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the death of the croſſe.</hi> And therefore in obedience to parents, children are to lay off all greatnes and excellencie whatſoeuer, and to ſubmit themſelues to any rebuke, yea euen to the ſhamefuleſt death, rather then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or diſobedience, to offend their parents.

But the Lord ſpake to the Iſraelities properly of the land that hee had promiſed them for an inheritance, which ſhould be vnto them as a teſtimonie and ſeale of his goodneſſe and loue toward them.

Who ſo honoreth his father ſhall haue ioy of his owne children, and when he maketh his praier, he ſhall be heard: He that honoreth his father ſhall haue a long life, and he that is obedient to the Lord, ſhall comfort his mother. He that feareth the Lord, honoreth his parents, and doth ſeruice vnto his parents as vnto Lords. Honor thy father and mother in deed and word, that thou maieſt haue Gods bleſsing, and that it may abide with thee vnto the end. For the bleſsing of the father eſtabliſheth the houſes of the children, and the mothers curſe rooteth out the foundations. Reioyce not at the diſhonor of thy father, for it is not honor vnto thee, but ſhame: Seeing that mans glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie commeth by his fathers honor, and the reproch of the mother is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the children. My ſonne, helpe thy father in his age, and grieue him not as long as hee lyueth. And if his vnderſtanding faile, haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience with him, and deſpiſe him not when thou art in thy full strength. For the good entreatie of thy father ſhall not be forgotten, but it ſhall bee a fortreſſe to thee against ſinnes.

And therfore it reſteth that they vnderſtanding them, do pray vnto God to giue them grace to put them in practiſe to his glory, and their good &amp; ſaluation. Laſtly, let them remember the ſaying of Plato, that God is not more enclined to heare any praiers, then ſuch as parents doe poure forth for their children. As they are therefore to feare their

And therefore ſaith the Prince of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. Herein reſteth a difference betweene a King and a tyrant That the tyrant ſeeketh his owne profit, the Kinge or Magiſtrate the profit &amp; commoditie of his ſubiects. Such (ſaith Cicero) as are to gouerne the common wealth, ought diligently to obſerue theſe two inſtructions of Plato: Firſt, that they ſo maintain the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of the people, that euery their action, without reſpect of their owne priuate profit may haue reſpect thereto: Secondly, that they tend to the preſeruation of the whole body of their people, &amp; that they ſeeke not ſo to maintaine one part, that they forſake the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Thus may the magiſtrate eaſily learne, that the greatneſſe of gouernment is but a greatnes of care: alſo that, as Seneca ſaith, he is in duty to warant the ſleep of his ſubiects by his own wakfulnes

And in that ſence doe we reade of a great perſonage who neuer accepted gouernment or publike office for his owne ſake, but for the common wealth of his countrie: ſo that on a time when the people were feaſting and very merrie, being asked why himſelfe walked ſadly vp and downe the towne, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: That you may make merrie and reioyce. Thus when the magiſtrate is called the ſheepeheard, the father, and head of the people, he is to remember that the ſheepheard being more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the ſheepe: the father then the children: and the head then the body: the ſheepheard, the father and the head, are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this preheminence, The one to lead and feed the flock: the other to nouriſh and bring vp his children, and the other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to gouerne the body. It is therefore the magiſtrates dutie ſo to gouerne his ſubiects,<note place="margin">Seneca of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie.</note> that by the effects they may know that he is ordained not onely to be ouer them, but alſo for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For the better vnderſtanding and practiſe hereof, let vs more perticularly lay down the dutie of their function, by three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall endes thereof before mentioned: Namely, that wee may liue a quiet and peaceable life, in al godlineſſe and honeſtie.

And therefore, to conclude this purpoſe, God ſpeaking to Ioſua, declareth that the ſame wiſedome which is the mother and nurſe of proſperitie, proceedeth of the reading &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in the word of God.</p>
               <p n="17">17 The premiſes doo manifeſtly declare, how mightily the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours in olde time were addicted to holineſſe, and how zealous they were in maintenance of the heauenly doctrine, and eſtabliſhment of the pure ſeruice of God, how carefull to cut off the courſe of hereſies, how affectionate to the reading of the holie Scriptures, how feruent in praiers and ſupplications. To be ſhort, how readie and reſolute in anie thing that might import the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the glory of God &amp; the Church of Ieſus Chriſt.

For ſith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and aduancement of the Church is vnto them commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord, as the chiefe &amp; principall end of their vocation, reaſon willeth, that they alſo haue knowledg of thoſe perſons that are to be as inſtruments &amp; helpes to them in the diſcharge of their office, which conſiſteth in the maintenance of their ſubiectes in true religion and the pure ſeruice of God.</p>

               <p n="20">20 It is therefore the magiſtrates dutie to maintaine the right &amp; authoritie of the church in all matters that concerne the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, and the exerciſe thereof, namely, againſt the diſturbers of the peace of the ſame, as heretikes; prophane perſons, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Eccleſiaſticall orders. And particularly, inaſmuch as the vſe of conſiſtories and ſynodes is requiſite for the bleſſed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Chriſts Church, it is the office of the magiſtrates to take order that it be maintained in certaine ſeaſons, according to the ſtate &amp; neceſsitie of the Churches, yea, &amp; to ſummon the ſame extraordinarily according to the extraordinarie occaſions that may fall out, and after the ancient practiſe and vſe of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperours.</p>

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:18664:175"/>24 The ſecond principall point of the duetie of Magiſtrates to their ſubiects, conſiſteth in the maintaining of them in a peaceable and quiet life,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.14. 1.

Now that they may well execute this part of their charge, it behoueth them to haue fit and conuenient lawes, whereby to maintaine theyr ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in peace and tranquility with right and equitie. And this did God manifeſtly declare, in deliuering by the hands of Moſes thoſe lawes, whereby he willed that his people Iſrael ſhould be directed &amp; gouerned. The heathen alſo haue euermore had moſt excellent perſonages to preſcribe vnto them their lawes: as Solon to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, and Lycurgus to the Lacedemonians.

                  <note place="margin">Lampridius in his lyfe.</note> firſt collected. Alexander Seuerus, an Emperour of Rome, ſhewed ſuch care heereof, that being to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a certaine lawe for the gouernment of his ſubiects, hee called twentie of the skilfulleſt and moſt learned Lawyers of his Empire, to haue their opinions, which hee demanded of each of them: and that not ſimply, but ſo, as that hee woulde alſo heare their reaſons: neither would he accept of anie preſent aunſwere, but gaue them time to conſider thereof, leaſt in a matter of ſo great importance, they might happily deliuer ſome raſh or vnpremeditated reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               </p>
               <p n="25">25 This likewiſe ought reſolutely to be grounded in the hearts of all magiſtrates, that if the ſuperior magiſtrate or ſoueraign ſhuld command his ſubſtitute or inferiour officer to iudge contrarie to lawe, he ſhould therein obey him, but God who commaundeth to miniſter iudgement and iuſtice according to the law.<note place="margin">Plutarch in his Apotheg.</note> And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did Antigonus the third thus write to Magiſtrates throughout the townes of his kingdome: If I command anie thing contrarie to the laws, obey not, but thinke that I was abuſed by ignorance. The Aegyptian kings proceeded farther, for they obſerued this law and cuſtome: They tooke an oath of their Iudges, that they ſhould not obey them, in caſe they ſhould command them to paſſe any vniuſt or wrongfull ſentence.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:18664:180"/> yee deſtroy the excommunicate from among you.</hi> Here do we ſee (which alſo is manifeſtly noted in the beginning of the hiſtorie) that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it Acan onely tooke of the thing excommunicate, yet was his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence imputed to all the people &amp; the wrath of God was kindled, not againſt Acan only, but alſo againſt all Iſraell, &amp; to conclude; that the puniſhment and execution of Acan was the only meanes to appeaſe that wrath, as it is expreſly ſet downe,<note place="margin">Ioſu. 5.25.</note> that after Acan was put to death, <hi>The Lord turned from his fierce wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40 Another excellent mirror and example of this doctrine, we haue in the hiſtorie of Ionas. He only offended God in ſeeking to flie from the preſence of the Lord to Tarſus: &amp; to the end ſhipped himſelfe: But God raiſed a tempeſt, a teſtimony of his wrath,<note place="margin">Ionas.</note> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him onely, but againſt all that were in the ſhip, who al were in danger of drowning. They ſought to ſaue themſelues by caſting their goods into the ſea: But it was in vaine. Then finding Ionas guiltie &amp; the motiue of this tempeſt, they made toward the ſhore to preſerue both him and themſelues: but God withſtood the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the only meanes to ſaue their ſhip &amp; themſelues, was by caſting Ionas into the ſea.

               <p n="41">41 If vpon the committing of ſome manſlaughter or ſome other notorious crime in ſome Towne or Cittie, the Lord by ſending an Earthquake, ſhould threaten to ſubuert the ſame, vntill the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were puniſhed, men would take better heede. And therefore this firſt reaſon ought earneſtly to touch the harts of Magiſtrates, &amp; to make them to puniſh the offences &amp; tranſgreſsions of their ſubiects: conſidering that otherwiſe they maintaine the wrath of God kindled againſt their whole nation. <hi>There ſhal not be,</hi> ſaith the Lord by the mouth of Moſes, <hi>any reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the blud that hath bin ſhed, but by the blud of him that hath ſhed it.</hi> And therefore hee doth expreſſely forbid the iudges not to take any rewarde for the life of the murtherer, who is wicked and deſerueth death, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth that he bee put alſo to death.<note place="margin">Numb. 35.33.</note> For (ſayeth hee) <hi>Bloud defileth the land, &amp; cannot be clenſed but by the death of the murtherer.</hi> And therefore, as when fire hath taken a houſe, men vſe to pull it downe &amp; to caſt it to the earth, leaſt it ſhould fire alſo the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſes: So muſt the magiſtrate pluck downe and puniſh the trenſgreſſor, leaſt the heate of Gods wrath be kindled, &amp; conſume al the people. The tranſgreſſion &amp; offence of one ſubiect, is as a ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="42">42 The other reaſon propounded by the Lord, importeth that by the puniſhment of ſin &amp; tranſgreſsion, the ſubiectes ſhall feare to commit like iniquities. And in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the puniſhment of tranſgreſſors vſually in all countries publike, to the end that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may vnderſtand, &amp; in themſelues find, that vpon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the like wickedneſſe, they ſhall in like maner bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and therefore may feare to offend. And is not this alſo the meaning of Gods iudgements and puniſhments executed vpon tranſgreſſors in this life, euen that others ſhould feare, &amp; ſhun ſin, leaſt they alſo ſhould fall into the like puniſhment? The Apoſtle Saint Paul,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.6,</note> ſpeaking of the ſundrye puniſhments inflicted vpon the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe, expreſſely ſaith. <hi>Theſe are examples vnto vs to the intent that we ſhould not lust after euill things, as they alſo luſted: That wee ſhould not commit fornication, as ſome of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. That we ſhould not tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted him and were destroyed of Serpents: Neither murmure, as ſome of them murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now all theſe thinges came vnto them as enſamples, and were written to admoniſh vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come: Wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heede leaſt he fall.</hi>

               <p n="43">43 This alſo is the fruit and purpoſe of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, which are performed in excommunication,<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 135, &amp; 17, 7.10. &amp; 21 21.</note> And this ſentence and commaundement is alſo many times directed to the magiſtrate, namely that hee put away the ſinne or the ſinner from among the people, by puniſhing him according to his offence. It is therfore the magiſtrates dutie to puniſh the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions of men, to the ende that others may feare to commit the like iniquitie· And indeede what will become of that Towne or prouince,<note place="margin">Eſay, 11.</note> wherein ſinne and wickedneſſe is not puniſhed? If as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay ſaith, men be each to other as Tigers, Lyons, Beares, Wolues and Serpents, what peace or tranquilitie can there bee among the people? if men bee not reſtrained from wickedneſſe by the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie puniſhment of tranſgreſſors?

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:18664:181"/> ſayth,<note place="margin">Aug. againſt Petilian. lib. 2. cap. 23.</note> Albeit the feare of puniſhment breedeth not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good conſcience, yet doeth it at the leaſt reſtraine the wicked deſyres incloſed in the ſecrets of the thought. And as it is the better parte that is induced to this dutie by loue, ſo is it the greater part that came to it by feare.</p>
               <p n="44">44 Yet is there another conſideration. Saint Paul exhorting vs not to requite euill with euill, but to giue place vnto wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.19.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this reaſon, <hi>Vengeance is Gods, and hee will repaie it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> And in the next Chapter he declareth, that God hath ordayned the ſuperior powers and magiſtrates, as his vicars &amp; lieutenants, deliuering to them the ſwoord to execute vengeance in his name. If the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate therefore doth not imploy his ſwoord and power to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the wicked, hee wrongeth thoſe that keepe themſelues within the compaſſe of Gods commandement, and doo depende vpon his promiſe, that hee wyll reuenge the iniuries that they doo beare: and withall, ſo farre as in him lyeth, he doth bring vpon the maieſtie of God a great reproch, as if hee were not eyther true or almightie to fulfyll his promiſe, or to take reuenge of thoſe that wrong others. To conclude, hee giueth occaſion to ſuch as be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured to defend themſelues, to render euill for euill, and ſo to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe vpon the authoritie of God, to whome only vengeance doth belong.</p>
               <p n="45">45 By the premiſes it euidently appeareth, that it is a meere &amp; moſt dangerous corruption, in ſhewing fauour to offenders, to let them eſcape vnpuniſhed, yet this was a cuſtome among the Iewes after the Romanes had ſubdued them, that at the feaſt of the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they would haue ſuch a priſoner let looſe vnto them, as them ſelues would demand, to the end to exempt him of his deſerued puniſhment: and thereupon was Barrabas, a ſeditious perſon and a murtherer, by them preferred before the righteous Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; by Pilat at their requeſt deliuered to go free without puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But greater corruption than this may wee finde among Chriſtians. Firſt, in that at the firſt entrie of kings &amp; princes into their towns,<note place="margin">Math. 27.</note> alſo in ſome places vpon the day that is tearmed <hi>Good friday,</hi> many tranſgreſſors are deliuered out of priſon. This is a peruerſe affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mercie in princes, and a wicked imitation of the grace and mercie of God. As alſo it it is a pernitious priuiledge pretended by thoſe that name themſelues Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the dutie &amp; authoritie of magiſtrates, to exempt from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by death ſuch manſtaiers as haue taken the firſt tonſure or crowne, as they tearme it. And therefore it is the office of the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18664:182"/> faithfull magiſtrate to aboliſh ſuch corruption.</p>
               <p n="46">46 What then? Is it not lawfull for the Prince to pardon an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender? In anſwere hereto, we ſay that he ought to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſinnes &amp; tranſgreſsions prepetrated contrarie to the law of God, which hee commandeth to puniſh: and ſuch offences as are committed againſt the lawes and ſtatutes of magiſtrates in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters either of warre, or pollicie only. As concerning the firſt, true it is that Chriſtan magiſtrates are not bound to inflict the ſame puniſhment, which God in his lawe hath decreed: Yet are they bound to obſerue this rule, namely that they puniſh all tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, each according to the grauitie thereof· For that doeth Gods Iuſtice require. Secondly that the grauitie as well of the offence, as of the puniſhment for the ſame bee eſtimated, not after the lycence and tolleration now in vſe euen among Chriſtians, but after the rule of Gods wiſedome reuealed in his word. Wherein wee are to conſider firſt the kindes of ſinne, as that murther is more heynous then theft, becauſe mans life is more precious then his goods. And therefore hath God decreed one puniſhment againſt the murtherer, and another againſt the theefe. Moreouer in one kinde of ſinne there are ſundrie circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunces to be conſidered, which make the ſinne, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe enforce or mitigate the puniſhment. As manſlaughter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ignorance, or at vnawares, is not ſo heinous, neither ſo ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee puniſhed as when it is doone vpon hatred and wilfully. And in that conſideration did the Lorde in olde time graunte townes of ſanctuarie for the ſafetie of ſuch as vnwittingly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to kill any man:<note place="margin">Deut. 14.<hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 35,</note> As contrariwiſe hee commaunded the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch as wilfully and vpon mallice ſlew any man, to bee performed without remiſsion or exception. So likewiſe doeth God by Moſes decree diuers ſortes of puniſhmentes for theft, according to the diuers circumſtaunces thereof:<note place="margin">Exod. 22.1.</note> And therfore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch conſiderations, noted in Gods worde, as the ſinne is more heynous or eaſie, euen ſo muſt the puniſhment be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without reſpect of perſons, whether kinsfolke or ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> friendes or vnknowne perſons: rich or poore: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. For as it is great rigour to condemne to death the man that by miſchaunce killeth one: So is it a mercie condemned by the Lorde himſelfe, to pardon him that wilfully committeth murder. Neither can it bee denyed, but that ſuch negligence as wee dayly ſee among Chriſtians in not puniſhing blaſphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Maieſtie, fornication, and eſpecially whoredome,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18664:182"/> haunting of Tauernes and ordinarie drunkenneſſe, cryeth for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt thoſe Magiſtrates that ſuffer ſuch abhomination to beare ſway and haue free paſſage, without exemplarie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requiſite for the appeaſing of Gods wrath: for the terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng of others: and for the maintenaunce of their ſubiectes in peace and tranquilitie. But as for tranſgreſsions againſt the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke lawes and Statutes of Magiſtrates, themſelues haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authoritie vpon ſundrie and diuers reaſons, to mittigate or wholly to remit the puniſhment. As when Saule following the Philiſtians,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14.</note> decreed death againſt anie that ſhoulde taſt anie foode before night, and therevpon determining the death of his ſonne Ionathan for taſting the honie: It reſted in the people to free him from death in reſpect of the great victorie by him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt the Philiſtians.</p>
               <p n="47">47 But in as much as there bee ſundrie Chriſtian Magiſtrates, that bee negligent in this dutie of puniſhing the treſpaſſes and offences of their Subiectes, in hope of amendement: Let ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the horrible vengeaunce executed vpon the enhabitants of Gibeah, and almoſt the whole tribe of Beniamin,<note place="margin">Iudges. 21. &amp;. 21.</note> who were in manner vtterly rooted out, becauſe that when the ſaide enhabitantes of Gibeah had committed great abhomination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Leuites concubine, the ſaid tribe of Beniamin refuſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to puniſh them, or to deliuer them into the hands of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell to be puniſhed. Let them conſider what became of the Lacedemonians, when they cared not to puniſh two of their Subiectes that had deflowred and murthered and throwne into a well the two daughters of Scedaſus, an enhabitant of Leuctres. This Scedaſus, vpon notice of this odious fact, complained to the Magiſtrates, tearmed the Ephores, and craued iuſtice: But in vaine. Then hee went to the King: but might not bee hearde.<note place="margin">Plut. in the life of Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas.</note> Thence to the people, weeping and crying out vpon ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: but no man tooke heede?

This hiſtorie doeth Plutarch, a heathen man, report, (which thus aptly fitteth our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to bee fought neere to Leuctres, the ſame ground where the two daughters of Scedaſus were buried: Yea hee addeth, that as Pelopidas, one of the Theban Captaines ſtoode in ſome doubte before the battell, Scedaſus appeared vnto hym in a

Let alſo the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to Achab by a prophet, concerning Benhadad king of Syria,<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="48">48 But as there is great difference betweene iuſtice &amp; crueltie, ſo this repreſentation of the duetie of magiſtrates to puniſh vice and ſin, according as iuſtice requireth, tendeth not to induce them to crueltie, but to the execution of the iuſt iudgement and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, according to his holy lawes and commaundements. For as for crueltie, it is ſo much the more deteſtable, as that there is nothing more againſt the nature of God,<note place="margin">Seneca of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy to Nero</note> and the coniunction that he hath conſtituted among men. It is, as Seneca ſayth, a vice not of man, but of a wild beaſt: and therefore it is to be abhorred and deteſted, but eſpecially by ſuch as are not onely men, but alſo the lieutenants and vicars of God, leaſt by crueltie they ſhoulde pollute and prophane the ſeate of his holy maieſtie. And they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo who vpon ambition, couetouſnes, wrath, or anie other paſsion, are moued and induced to this crueltie, cannot but expect iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, and conſequently, horrible and fearefull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the hatred and feare of men, and ſo leade a moſt miſerable &amp; wretched life both in this world and in the world to come, as by the examples of many tyrants from time to time we may euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue. And Ariſtotle in his Politikes noteth, that tyrannie can neuer holde out in one family to the fourth generation: for in deede, crueltie can haue no continuance, and hee that is feared and dreaded of many, doth alſo ſtand in feare and dread of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

               <p n="58">58 To conclude, Magiſtrates are to remember, that in old time God commanded that the ſonnes of Aaron the prieſt ſhuld ſound the trumpets whereſoeuer there was anie queſtion of warres.<note place="margin">Numb. 10.9 Deut. 20.1</note> Alſo
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18664:186"/> that the prieſt ſhould then ſpeake to the people, to exhort them not to feare or doubt, and to aſſure them that God marched with them to fight for them againſt their enemies. For herein princes &amp; magiſtrates are admoniſhed and taught, firſt not to leuie anie war but that which is iuſt, approued by God, and as it were ſummoned thereto by Gods trumpet: ſecondly, ſo to behaue themſelues as in his preſence &amp; vnder his conduct: thirdly, not to truſt to their own ſtrength, neither to feare the ſtrength of their enemies, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues vppon God, the captaine and conducter of the war: ſo that albeit their enemies be more in number, yet they may be aſſured through Gods aſsiſtance to ouercome them. Thus wil he giue them grace either to preuent the tribulations of war, or els to vndertake &amp; leade happy &amp; bleſſed wars, whereby ouercomming their enimies, they may keep their ſubiects in peace &amp; proſperity.</p>
               <p n="59">59 We haue already declared how far the duty of the magiſtrate doth extend, namely, ſo to imploy his authoritie, that his ſubiects may liue religiouſly in all godlynes, and peaceably in tranquilitie.

Now this honeſtie conſiſteth principally in two things: firſt, that among ſubiects ther be found no pollution in fornication, luſt &amp; other villanies: ſecondly, that al dronkennes, gluttony, &amp; ſuch like exceſſe &amp; riot be ſuppreſſed, banniſhed, and driuen awaie. As concerning the firſt point, God in his word doth ſufficiently teſtifie, and by the examples of diuers his vengeances, declare that he deteſteth all fornication: and the magiſtrate is the ſeruant of God, it is therefore his dutie to conforme his will to the will of his God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by making co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient decrees to reſtrain all whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; fornication, by aboliſhing all occaſions,<note place="margin">Exod 20.19 Leuit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In olde time theeues were not by anie lawe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God or man puniſhed wyth death, but adulterers were: but now contrarywiſe, theeues muſt die for it, and adulterers muſt eſcape in manner ſcotfree.

Neither is this a bond of mercenarie ſouldiers, that without neceſsitie doe voluntarily binde themſelues: But it is a bond in nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently neceſſarie. For as God armeth the magiſtrate with the ſwoord for the preſeruation of his ſubiects againſt the violence of their enemies, and to enforce rebels to yeelde obedience to their lawfull decrees: So when alone, or with his ſargeants he is not able to performe this dutie, he may and ought to commaunde his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to helpe him to execute his office: and they are bound at his commandement to take armes &amp; to imploy themſelues. Subiects do reſemble a body guided by a head which is the magiſtrate: As therefore by naturall affection the hands and other the members of the body, doe ſtand bound to imploy themſelues for the ſafetie of the body, but eſpecially of the head againſt all violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie: So ought all ſubiects, to thinke vpon this naturall bond and affection, and in dutie vnder the conduct of their head to preſerue the body of the communaltie, but eſpecially the perſon &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their Prince and Magiſtrate, againſt the violence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours of their enemies.

But the end of the miniſtery tendeth to aſſemble from this diſsipation the elect in Ieſus Chriſt, to make them pertakers of that ſaluation that is in him. And this doth the other ſimilitude of the building of the body of Chriſt confirme: for as they which are ſeperate from Chriſt our life, are in death: ſo the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue and ſaue them reſteth in this, that we be builte and engraffed into the body of Chriſt, that we may be ſaued in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon doth S.

The miniſters of the woorde therefore, whenſoeuer they perceiue anie tokens of Gods wrath againſt the Church, are eſpecially, as it were, to oppoſe themſelues, and to turne the ſame awaie by feruent prayer.

               <p>IN as much as the word <hi>Father,</hi> mentioned in the fifth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the law, doth alſo include the Paſtors and Miniſters of Gods word, it followeth that the word <hi>honor</hi> muſt comprehend the duties of the Church towards them: and ſeing the ſaid word <hi>honor,</hi> ſignifieth the loue, reuerence, ſubiection, and obedience, with aſsiſtance in time of neede: it therby appereth that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church are bound to doe theſe duties to their Paſtors. Firſt to loue and beare them affection: as alſo the dutye of this honoring is compriſed in the ſummary of the ſecond table of the law, which containeth the loue to our neighbour. And indeed, if we ought to loue al men, euen our enemies, how much rather thoſe whom God vſeth for to beget vs to the Lord, that we may be the children and heires of his heauenly and euerlaſting kingdome? Surely ſith the ſoule is ſo excellent, and the holye and euerlaſting life ſo much to be deſired, wee cannot in truth ſufficiently loue thoſe good and faithfull Paſtors,<note place="margin">Iohn 6, 27.</note> Fathers and nources of our ſoules that doe inſtruct vs in holineſſe, and lead vs to life euerlaſting. If we ought to labour, not for the meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth vnto euerlaſting life: then truely the Paſtors that feede our ſoules with ſpirituall and eternall foode, are more to be loued, then they which giue vs bodily bread. Alexander the great did highly reuerence and affect his ſcholemaſter Ariſtotle, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:18664:213"/> ſaid that he was no leſſe bound to him, then to his Father:<note place="margin">Eraſ. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theg. lib. 4.</note> for as from his Father he receiued the beginning of his life, ſo from his ſcholemaiſter he tooke the beginning liuing well: How much rather ſhould we affect &amp; loue our faithful miniſters, from whom we receaue our beginning to liue well according to God, whereby to attaine to life euerlaſting?<note place="margin">Galat. 4.14.</note> The Galathians ſhewed a maruelous loue and affection to Saint Paul, as he himſelfe witneſſeth, ſaying: that they receiued him as an Angell of God, yea, euen as Chriſt himſelfe: teſtifiyng alſo that if poſsible they could, they would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen haue pulled out their eyes to haue giuen them to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Of this affection and loue is engendred a certaine reſpect and reuerence toward them,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <hi>4.</hi>1. Tit. 1.7. 2. Cor. 5.20. 1. Cor. 3.9. 2. Cor. 3.6.</note> the rather in conſideration of their charge, whereto God hath called them, in that they are the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the ſecretes and miſteryes of carnall ſaluation: Gods Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt, bringing the meſſage of our attonement with God: coadiutors or labourers with God in the ſaluation of men: Miniſters of the new couenaunt, not of the letter, but of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Theſe ſo honourable tytles and moſt excellent offices in the ſight of God, doe ſufficiently and plainely declare what reſpect and reuerence the Church ought to beare vnto them. Alſo,<note place="margin">Luke 10.16.</note> that who ſo deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth Chriſt in them, as himſelf prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and are vnthankfull for the benefites and bleſsings that God offereth by them: but eſpecially they are to be loued &amp; regarded when they doe faithfully and diligently behaue themſelues in their charge, according as their tytles doe admoniſhe and binde them. And in this reſpect doth the holy Apoſtle Saint Paul ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorte the Theſſalonians to this duetye, ſaying: <hi>Bretheren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>we beſeech you that ye know,</hi> (that is to ſay, that ye loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) <hi>thoſe which labour among you, and are ouer you in the Lord, and admoniſhe you: that yee haue them in ſingular loue for their workes ſake.</hi> The ſame doth he alſo ſignifie in his Epiſtle written to the Philippians. For hauing touched the vertues of Epaphroditus,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.29.</note> he exhorteth them to receiue him in the Lord with all ioye, and to eſteeme of all that are ſuch. Beſides that in ſo dooing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors will be the better affected to their flocke, taking the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care for their good and ſaluation, and employ themſelues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the more cheerefullye, as the Apoſtle Saint Paul writing to the Corinthians, ſaith of Titus, namely, that when hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred their obedience,<note place="margin">

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writing to the beleeuing Hebrues, commandeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obey their Paſtors,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> &amp; to ſubmit themſeues to them: his reaſon: <hi>For they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt giue accompts, that they may doe it with ioy and not with griefe, for that is vnprofitable for you.</hi> This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection and obedience conſiſteth eſpecially in three points: Firſt, in diligent hearing of Sermons, communicating in the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and aſsiſting at publike praiers. Secondly, in bringing forth fruit, and ſhewing the effects of theſe ſacred exerciſes. Thirdly, in receiuing the admonitions, reprehenſions and exhortations of the worde in all humilitie and modeſtie.<note place="margin">In the ſecond book. cap. 3.4.5. &amp; 8.</note> But ſeeing we haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before treated of theſe points, eſpecially of the two firſt, we will not any more inſiſt vpon them in this place, onely we will adde this briefe aduertiſement, that as they that ſit at a table doe eate, chewe, and diſgeſt their foode, ſo they that heare the word of God ought to liſten vnto it, meditate vpon it, &amp; print it in their hartes, that ſo they may receiue the nouriſhment ſignified by the worde and duetie <hi>to feede,</hi> commended to the Shepheards of Chriſts flock. And as in meate we are not ſomuch to ſeek lickorouſnes as health, ſo muſt it be in the preaching of the worde: for Eccleſiaſticall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies be not like to common playes whereto men reſorte for pleſure: but in ſermons we are to loke for that which is helthſome for the ſoule: and as in a banquet, if any diſhe chaunce to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, or otherwiſe it is not well dreſſed, the ſame doth not ſo offend vs that therefore we can eate but little of the reſt that is well ſeaſoned: ſo if in ſermons we heare any ſentence or word, not ſo fitly applied as it wer to be wiſhed, we muſt not for that leaue to make our profite of the reſt that is wel &amp; deuoutly ſpoken. S. Paul confeſſeth that himſelfe hath no eloquence, neither alluring ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in his preachings, and thereof addeth one notable reaſon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>That your faith may not be in the wiſedome of men, but in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

Moreuer, as it is in vaine to call the Phiſition and to heare his counſell, when wee liſt not to take the medicine that he doth preſcribe: ſo they that heare the ſermons and doe not put the wordes in practiſe, in ſteade of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping profite, ſhall incurre the greater damnation: for as hee that hauing bene two or three yeeres at ſchoole and hath not profited, is worthie to be taken away: ſo they that haue bene many yeeres in the ſchoole of Chriſt and heard his worde, yet doe not amende, neither increaſe in faith and loue, doe worthily deſerue to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of ſuch a benefite of God, and according to the threatning of Amos, to endure ſuch a famine, not of bread, but of the worde,<note place="margin">Amos 8.11.</note> that the ſtrongeſt and moſt luſtie, ſeeking after it but not finding it, may periſhe.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Now it reſteth that we ſpeak of the third parte, ſignified in the worde <hi>Honor,</hi> which is the aſsiſtaunce of the Paſtour, and this is to be practiſed eſpecially in two ſortes: Firſt, the Church is in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to prouide that her Miniſters may haue conuenient maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, leaſt they ſhould be withdrawne from their charge by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for the ſuſtenance of their family. True it is, that S.<note place="margin">Act. 20.34.</note> Paul did ſometimes labour with his handes for his liuing: but it was when the Churches had no meanes to prouide for him, by reaſon of perſecution: or elſe when he perceiued that by receiuing his maintenance from the Church, there was ſome back-ſliding in the preaching of the Goſpel: as at Corinth. For when ſome falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached there without reward, Saint Paul would be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident for them to receiue maintenance from the Church, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe writeth vnto them, ſaying: <hi>We haue not vſed this power,</hi>

For firſt he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>O man, who art thou which ſpeakeſt againſt God?</hi> Thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that where men dare replie, and thus accuſe God of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, becauſe they vnderſtand not his reaſons? the ſame doth proceed of this, that they remember not that themſelues are men, either what man is in regard of God.

               <p n="11">11 As for the ſecond point, the Apoſtle confirmeth the ſame that hee had before ſpoken, namely, that God hath mercie vpon whome he will, and hardneth whome hee will: declaring by the ſimilitude of a potter, that hee hath power and authoritie ſo to doo: And in deede, <hi>Hath not the potter power of the claie,</hi>

               <p n="17">17 In the meane time, for the better vnderſtanding of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp; knowledg in this doctrine, we ſaie, that if we ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the conſideration of mans creation to the image of God, both hee and all that are deſcended of him were created to life, for in man crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the image of God, there was no matter or argument of death: But if wee ſpeake of the predeſtination hidden in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell of God, the ſame is a profound deapth, that ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen rauiſh vs into admiration.

Not that there was not in God a former counſell which went before, wherby he had decreed and diſpoſed of his creatures vpon certaine cauſes to vs vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: but for that from the tranſgreſsion of Adam proceeded the curſe and death of mankinde. Saint Paule ſayth that God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red veſſels of mercie for his glorie, becauſe that all that the elect haue to guide them to life euerlaſting, proceedeth of the grace of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.13</note> but others are prepared to perdition, becauſe they are giuen
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:18664:224"/> ouer to themſelues, ſo that following their owne corruptions, they go according to the eternall decree of God, to deſtruction. And heereof do we gather that albeit God had iuſt cauſe, to vs vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, thus to diſpoſe of his creatures, by chooſing ſome, and reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other ſome, yet did hee not hate or condemne anie thing but ſinne and corruption. It is not therefore fit that wee ſhould ſeeke the cauſe of the deſtruction of the reprobate in heauen, when wee ſee that it reſteth in earth: neither that we ſhould impute that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God which is in man himſelfe: neither ſhould the reprobate alſo murmure at the mercie of God poured vppon the elect, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that God may doo good to whom he wil, either at their owne deſtruction, whereof there reſteth a twofold occaſion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, namely, original ſin, &amp; the iniquities that do therof daily proceed.</p>

And in deed, the holy Scripture in infinite places doth teſtifie, that all things depend vpon his prouidence &amp; decree. If a ſparow falleth not to the ground without the will of God, ſhall man, ſo excellent a creature, created after the image of God, take ſo horrible a fall without his prouidence and decree? A man may giue a little child ſome ſmall ſtripe with a rod, without the parents appointment, which notwithſtanding they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture diſſemble and winke at: but none dare vndertake to cut him of the ſtone, or to cut off any lim, without his fathers good will and authority: Euen ſo, the greater that the importance of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams tranſgreſsion was, in that it tended to deſtroie &amp; ouerthrow ſo excellent a work of God, namely, man, created to his image: the more are we to beleeue, that it was neuer doone without his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell or decree. Moreouer, if in his prouidence hee hath ordained what he will haue done with all other creatures, hath he not, think you, ordained what ſhall be done with the principall and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, for which he created all the others? Again, if God creating all the world, and man to his own image, purpoſed that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of his worke ſhould be the manifeſtation of his glory: did he not alſo ordaine meanes to attaine thereto? But the fall of man was as it were, a preamble and a preparation, to declare his loue in his redemption through Chriſt, &amp; to make manifeſt his mercie to his elect, &amp; his iuſtice to the reprobate. And in this eſpecially doth the glorye of God appeare. If there were ſinne in the fall of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſo was there in the purſuite againſt Ieſus Chriſt: And yet loe, the Apoſtles ſpeaking vnto Almightie God doeth ſaie:

Albeit they cannot comprehend that Adams tranſgreſsion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was ſinne, came not to paſſe without the prouidence and decree of God, and yet that God is not the author of ſinne. Muſt they therefore denie his prouidence, &amp; thoſe places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein the holy Ghoſt doth ſo often and ſo euidently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame? Or contrarie to ſo many teſtimonies of his word will they make God the author of ſinne? They do not murmure, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, or replie againſt vs, but againſt the holy Ghoſt? Muſt they, becauſe they cannot comprehend how it ſhould bee poſsible that God ſhould prohibite Adam that thing, which neuertheleſſe came not to paſſe without his decree, will, and eternall counſell, denie thoſe teſtimonies which himſelfe deliuereth in his word, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly gather, that in God there ſhould bee two contrerie wills?

Firſt Saint Auguſtine ſaith, in that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth God the Lord of all, he doth ſhew that he had power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to diſpoſe of his creatures as he wold. Secondly, in that he ſaith, that God created all things good, he noteth that God is the author of the goodnes that hath bin in all his creatures, namely, in man, created to his image, but not of the ſin afterward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Thirdly, in that he knew, that from good they ſhould degenerate
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:18664:225"/> to euill, and yet that voluntarily he permitted it, hee propoundeth this reaſon: that it better beſeemed him to ſhewe his almightye goodneſſe, in making of euill good, then in permitting the euill: And then he ſheweth the good that God gathered out of the fall of Adam. Firſt, that it ſerued to ſhew what freewill was able to do, thereby ſignifiyng that there is no ſtedfaſtneſſe but in God: and yet that Adam was inexcuſable in his fall. For hauing created man with free will, his ſinne was not vpon compulſion, but voluntarily: and indeed he did eate of the forbidden fruit, not to the end to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the decree of God, wherof he was yet ignorant: but at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of Satan, and vpon a luſt to be like vnto God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when God reproued him, he complained not of Gods decree but of his wife Eue, and his wife of the Serpent:<note place="margin">Gen 3.6. and <hi>3.</hi>12.13.14.</note> and God in his ſentence pronounced againſt them, denounceth them all to be guiltie and worthy of puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="20">20 For the ſecond fruit gathered in the fall of Adam, hee ſaith: that it ſerued to declare the benefite of the grace of God to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: and conſequently to cauſe vs to confeſſe that our ſaluation is indeed free, and grounded vpon the onely loue and mercye of God. Alſo that this we ought not to miſdoubt, becauſe hereby we are pulled out of the gulfe of death and damnation, whereinto by Adams tranſgreſsion we were plunged: likewiſe that he hath elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, to the ende to make vs pertakers of ſo great a benefit: and left and abandoned ſo many others of like condition as ours, in the deapth of euerlaſting woe: and to ſaue vs, hath deliuered his onely begotten ſonne Ieſus Chriſt to the death. Finally, in that he ſaith that he vouchſafed to ſhewe the iudgement of his iuſtice, namely, vpon the reprobate, he thereby repreſenteth vnto vs, that they haue no cauſe to murmure or contende: and indeede as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready we haue ſhewed, that Adam was in his fall inexcuſable, ſo are they who being in Adam, did with him fall into death and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: for the ſinne and corruption is in them, and proceedeth from Adam, not from God. And albeit that which they doe is not without the prouidence and determinate counſell of God, yet not knowing, neither hauing any regarde thereof, but voluntarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning themſelues to ſinne, and executing, as S.

               <p>SVch as cauill againſt this doctrine of predeſtination and Gods prouidence, do among other matters alleadge this falſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, which is an enemy to the amendment of life, and that in two ſortes, and ſay, if we be predeſtinate to be of the number of the reprobate, it is in vaine for vs to endeuour to liue wel and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, for albeit we ſhould amend, yet of neceſsitie we muſt be damned. Others ſay, if we be elect, we cannot periſhe, albeit we doe euill and neuer amend our liues. But let vs conſider the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their ſpeeches, and then we will declare in how many ſortes, and how earneſtly the doctrine of Gods predeſtination and prouidence ſhould moue vs to amend. Firſt, it is a great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reiect the euident teſtimonies of Gods worde, vpon an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity forged in mans braine, as in old time did the Saduces, who denyed the reſurrection:<note place="margin">Mat. 22.23. Mat 20, 16. Mar. 13 20. Eph. 1.4. Rom. 9.11. and 11.5. Phil. 4.3. Iud. verſe 4.</note> Gods worde in many places, and very plainely doth teſtifie, that God hath elected ſome to ſaluation, and reiected other ſome, that being giuen ouer to themſelues, they might be reproued. Thoſe men therfore doe growe to great raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that dare alleadge that it is in vaine to amend, in caſe they be reprobates: that by this abſurditye forged in their own brains, they may cauil and reiect this doctrine of predeſtination, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently deny the worde of God: let them rather acknowledge their ignorance, and confeſſe that they ought to beleeue and doe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:18664:227"/> that which God ſaith, albeit they cannot comprehend the reaſon therof, and not complaine in their falſe conceits, and ſo reiect the euident teſtimonies of the holy ſcripture. Secondly, in as much as God, who knoweth both the elect and the reprobate, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all to amend,<note place="margin">2. Tim. <hi>2.</hi>19. Iohn 13.8.</note> with what conſcience can they which know not whether they be of the number of the reprobates, think to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themſelues from their due obedience, or alleadge that it were in vaine, in caſe they were reprobates: for they cannot deny but that all men are bound to obey God, vnder paine of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen albeit they could not comprehend whereto this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould ſerue, yea or that of their obedience they ſhould not looke to reape any benefite or profit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Thirdly, ſuch as God hath forſaken, and ſo are reprobates, can neuer amend, and therefore it is a falſe preſuppoſion, to ſay that it were in vaine for them to amend, in caſe they ſhould be of the number of the reprobate, conſidering that it cannot be that the reprobate ſhould amend: as if a man ſhould ſay, ſeeing that hee that ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall neuer obtaine remiſsion of his ſinne, it is in vaine for him to amend: this ſpeech preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth falſe, namely that he can amend: ſo likewiſe that it is in vaine for a reprobate to amend is a falſe imagination, becauſe no repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate can amend. Againe, the ſame which thoſe men doe confeſſe, muſt be done for the bodily life,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31.</note> becauſe they know not how God hath ordained therof, doth condemne them in that which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning the ſoule: for not knowing how God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined of their bodily life or death, they can confeſſe that they muſt eate and drinke to preſerue life, and neuer alleadge that it is in vaine, in caſe God hath decreed that they ſhould dye the next day. In matter therefore of the ſoule they are likewiſe to confeſſe, that they ought to amend, and neuer to alledge that it is in vaine, in caſe their place be among the reprobate: otherwiſe, that which they eat and drinke for the preſeruing of their tranſitory liues, wil beare witneſſe againſt them, that the allegation of this ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urditye by themſelues forged, doth in matter of the ſoule proceede either of groſſe ignorance or of malice and peeuiſhneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Moreouer, as the effect of Predeſtination ſheweth it ſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the obedience or diſobedience to Gods worde: ſo they which ſay that if they be not of the number of the elect, it is in vaine for them to amend, doe teach men to take the marke and way of the reprobate, which is, not to amend: rather ſhould the horrible puniſhment of the reprobate induce them to amend, in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:18664:228"/> hope that by amendment, they may grow into the number of the eiect.<note place="margin">Marc. 1.15.</note> To conclude, where God preaching his Goſpell, declareth that it is his will that thou ſhouldeſt beleeue, &amp; amend, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.17.</note> Why doſt thou reiect his reuealed wil, vnder a pretence that thou wotteſt not what hee hath determined of thee in his ſecret counſaile? Why doſt thou not rather giue credit to his proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Ezech. <hi>33.</hi>11.</note> who ſaith? <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould conuert and liue.</hi> Conuert therfore and liue, and forſaking that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſuggeſtion of the deuill, who ſaieth: Peraduenture it is in vaine for thee to conuert, for if thou beeſt none of the elect, thou ſhalt not liue: doe God that honor to beleeue that hee is true and the deuill a lyer: for in that doubte, whether thou beeſt elect or no, know thou that conuerſion and amendment, is a token &amp; fruit of thy election: and contrariwiſe, obſtinacie and proceeding in wickednes, is a manifeſt ſigne of reprobation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let vs now come to the other propoſition. If we be elect, ſay they, we cannot periſh, and therefore need not to amend. Firſt, this is the ſpeeche of a hyreling, who properly feareth not to offend God, but to be puniſhed by God, for that he would not amend but for feare of damnation. Secondly, in as much as by the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our liues, God is greatly glorified, and our neighbours edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Confeſſe, that either thou makeſt no accompt of the glory of God, or the ſaluation of thy neighbours, or elſe that thy ſpeeche is peruerſe, when thou ſaieſt, Being elected I cannot periſh, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neede not to amend: for albeit amendment ſhould ſtand thee in no ſtead, yet is it requiſite and meet that thou ſhouldſt amend, were it but to glorifie God,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> and to helpe to the ſaluation of thy neighbour: and heereto art thou bound, becauſe God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee to loue him with all thy hart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Thirdly, thou doſt plainely beat downe this purpoſe of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which S. Paul doth propound,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note> when he ſaith: <hi>God hath elected vs that we might be holy and vnreproueable.</hi> As if a Souldier ſaith, I am enrowled, and therefore I need not to fight: wil not euery man ſay that he doth but mocke, for hee is not enrowled for any other end: euen ſo doe wee mocke with God, if we ſay that being elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we need not to liue vertuouſly, conſidering that contrariwiſe we are elected onely to this end, to be holy.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Again, election to ſaluation doth not aboliſh, but eſtabliſh the ſecond cauſes and the meanes by God ordeined for the attayning therto. And indeed, God for the ſauing of his elect, hath ordained that they ſhould beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt: that to procure beleefe
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:18664:228"/> they ſhould heare the Goſpell: that they ſhould pray to God to giue them his holy ſpirite: that they ſhould amend and walke in his feare: and that they ſhould be exhorted to theſe duties, God, I ſay, hath in his wiſedome ordeined all theſe meanes, whereby to bring his elect to eternall ſaluation. What raſheneſſe is it therfore in man, to vpholde that the elect neede not beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, heare the holy Goſpell, or amende their liues? To be ſhorte, that they neede not the meanes ordeyned by God for the bringing of them vnto life euerlaſting? Is not this to ſeeke to be wiſer then God, to ſtriue againſt his wiſedome, to reuerſe his will, and to aboliſh the meanes whereby hee hath ordeined to bring the elect to ſaluation? When therefore to the end to bring the doctrine of predeſtination into hatred, thou ſaieſt, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it doth neceſſarily followe that the elect need not to heare the Goſpell, to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, to amend their liues, to praye to God, or to be exhorted to theſe duties: thou ſeeſt that it is all falſe, and that contrariwiſe, God will ſaue his electe by theſe meanes, which in his wiſedome hee hath ordeyned. Neceſſarilye therefore, the elect muſt be ſaued: yet by ſuch meanes as God hath ordeined for the bringing of them to ſaluation. God hath limited to euerye man the terme of his life, but withall hee hath ordained and appointed that for the preſeruing thereof, he ſhall both eate and drinke. If thou ſayeſt that thou ſhalt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie liue thy courſe that God hath preſcribed, and therefore that for the preſeruation of thy life thou needeſt not to eate or drinke: thou doſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in directly fight and ſtriue againſt the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God: and this is temptation: neither doſt thou notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God hath decreed the time of thy life, forbeare to eate or drinke. Why then doſt thou not the like for thy ſoule? as hee therefore that ſhould abſtaine from foode, and ſay that he neede it not to liue by, ſhould drawe to this end: ſo they that ſaye, that being elect they neede not beleeue the Goſpell, nor amend their liues, for the atteyning to the kingdome of heauen, do teach men to tempt God, and reuerſing his prouidence, ſtriuing againſt his will, and ſo farre as in them lyeth, aboliſhing the meanes and way to life and ſaluation, doe drawe on to death and eternall damnation. Which is more, if any man aske the cauſe why ſome doe beleeue and amend their liues, and others doe not, the holy Ghoſt doth aunſwere, That it is election that maketh this difference: ſo farre therefore are the elect from no neede of this
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:18664:229"/> holy life, is they doe pretend, that contrariwiſe, holineſſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life is the token and fruit of their election. Againe, wherefore doe they ſay that if there be election, the elect ſhal not need to liue in holineſſe? they doe this, as is aforeſaide, onely by ſuch an abſurditie to proue that there is no election, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there be ſo many and euident teſtimonies therof in the word of God,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.27.

But amendment of life is vnto vs as a meſſage, witneſſe and ſeale of our election, for as election is the cauſe and fountaine of amendment, ſo doth amendment leade vs to our election, as the effect to the cauſe, the fruite to the tree or roote, the brooke to the ſpring, and the light to the Sunne.

               <p n="14">14 There is yet another notable fruit, which ſome doe beate downe, by maintaining that God offereth to all men ſaluation and life euerlaſting, and according as himſelfe did foreſee that ſome ſhould accept it, and beleeue and liue well, ſo he did elect them, to encreaſe in them his graces and to ſaue them. And as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſhould reiect the ſaluation offered, and liue amiſſe, he hath predeſtinated them to take from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe graces that they had, and ſo to reiect and damne them. Theſe men are poſſeſſed with two errors, repugnant to the glory of God, and the ſaluation of man. Concerning the firſt which is the vniuerſall calling of all
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:18664:232"/> men, if thereby they vnderſtand the creation and gouernement of the worlde. God doth indeed inuite man to loue, feare, and praiſe him: but as hee offereth vnto them neither Ieſus Chriſt, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſins, ſo can it not be tearmed a calling to ſaluation and life euerlaſting: and thus the creation of the worlde, is not a calling that may make man to be ſaued,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> and conſequently elect: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that haue had no other calling, haue beene (as Saint Paul ſaith of the Epheſians, before the goſpel was preached vnto them) Strangers from the couenant of the promiſe, out of Chriſt, without hope, and without God in this world. Secondly, if by the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall calling, they meane the preaching of the Goſpel, experience ſheweth,<note place="margin">Act. 19.6.7.</note> and the holy ſcripture ſufficiently teſtifieth, that there were and yet are many nations in the worlde, to whom God hath not vouchſafed to direct his worde, to call them: as wee alſo read that God forbad Paul that he ſhould not preach in Aſia, neither ſuffered him to goe to Bithinia, and therefore it cannot be truely ſaide that this vocation was vniuerſall and common to all men.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.9.</note> Thirdly, there is a holy calling, as S. Paul termeth it, proceeding from the holy Ghoſt, which is proper and peculier to the elect, and not vniuerſall. Of the ſecond, Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh, ſaying: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are called, but few are choſen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 20.16. Rom. 8.29.</note> and <hi>S.</hi> Paul of the third, ſaith: <hi>Thoſe whom God knew before and predeſtinated, hath hee alſo called.</hi> And whereas theſe men doe alleadge the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that he will ſaue all, becauſe he addeth, <hi>and they ſhall come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> it doth appeare that he there ſpeaketh not of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4.</note> to whom he would not haue his worde, which containeth all truth, preached. Secondly, the following of the text doth manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that S.

               <p n="15">15 By the reiecting of this error, the elect may vnderſtand, that hauing bene called: Firſt, by the preaching of the Goſpell: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the power of the holy Ghoſt: ther are in them as it were two elections. The one in that God almighty leauing ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whom hee hath not at all addreſſed the doctrine of his Goſpell, hath elected them, to deliuer it vnto them: the other, in that reiecting ſo many others, to whom he hath ſent the preaching of his Goſpell, and yet neuertheleſſe calleth them not by his holy
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:18664:232"/> ſpirite: hee hath elected them, that they might be called by the light and power thereof, to the ende hee might ſaue them in his kingdome and glory. And this conſideration is vnto them as a twofold obligation wherein they are doubly bound as well inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to praiſe God, as alſo to loue him, and conſequentlye to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their liues. And indeede, if they that had the firſt grace, namely the preaching of the Goſpell, and doe not beleeue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, ſhalbe more hardly entreated in the day of iudgement the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enhabitants of Sodome and Gomorrah: what do they deſerue that are partakers alſo of the ſecond grace,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.15.</note> and haue the Goſpell preached vnto them, with the power &amp; efficacie of the holy ghoſt, whereby they beleeue and are made the children of God: in caſe the feeling of ſuch a benefite truely incomprehenſible, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as it were from the bowels of Gods mercy &amp; loue toward them, ſhould not kindle their harts with a holy affection and zeale to amend their liues?</p>
               <p n="16">16 As concerning the other error: that the election of ſome and not of other ſome, came of this, that God did foreſee that the men ſhould doe either well or euill, as the Pelagians did in olde time teach: one only place of Saint Paul will be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it. <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.<hi>3</hi>

Firſt, where the Apoſtle ſaith that God hath bleſſed vs, hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the ſpirituall bleſsings, whereof he ſpeaketh, are the giftes of the Father of light, and come not of ourſelues. Secondly, adding that he hath bleſſed vs in Chriſt? he declareth that thoſe bleſſings are imparted vnto vs, not for our owne ſakes, but for Chriſtes ſake. Thirdly, in this, according as he had choſen vs, and that in Chriſt, he noteth that our election commeth of God, and is grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Chriſt, and not vpon vs. Fourthly, adding that hee had choſen vs, before the foundation of the worlde, and ſo before that man was, he would that we ſhould acknowledge our electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to proceed from the eternall wil and counſell of God, &amp; not from our works, or our acceptation of his grace vnto vs offered. Fifthly, he hath euidentlye declared this in that he ſaith that we were choſen, not
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:18664:233"/> in reſpect of any holynes that he foreſaw in vs: but to the end that we might be holy &amp; vnreproueable in his ſight. And therfore it is not the acceptation of Gods graces and the faithfull vſe of the ſame, foreſeene in vs, that maketh vs to be choſen: but euen the election it ſelf, which bringeth forth this acceptation of grace, and conſequently faith and good workes. Sixtly he addeth, according to the good pleaſure of his will to ſhewe that our election depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the onely goodnes and will of God, and not of men. Seuenthly, he confirmeth it, adding to the praiſe, and glory of the grace of God: for if election had proceeded from the freewill and workes of men, the praiſe and glorye thereof, as Saint Paul many times noteth, would haue redounded to themſelues, and not to God?<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>4.</hi>2.</note> and ſo God ſhould not haue elected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they ſhould haue elected themſelues. Laſtly, in adding, that of his grace hee hath made vs acceptable in his wel beloued, he euidentlye doth ſhew, that it is not our acceptation of his grace that hath made vs acceptable, whereby we ſhould be elected: but only his grace and the loue that he beareth to Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

But the Apoſtle in not propounding this for the maintaining of Gods iuſtice, doth ſufficiently ſhew that we muſt not vſe it: and that it is a vaine and falſe allegation. And indeed in another place for the foundation of our election and ſaluation, oppoſing againſt the works of iuſtice, not thoſe which our ſelues ſhall doe, but the mercy of God, he plainly ſheweth that our electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not wrought by the workes foreſeene, either done or to doe: but by the onelye mercye of God.</p>

Let vs therefore acknowledge this prouidence of God, who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſeruice of men to afflict vs, that wee may in humbling our ſelues in the ſight of God, and praiſing him: alſo in renouncing all hatred, bitterneſſe, and deſire of reuenge agaynſt man, amend our liues.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Now if this doctrine admoniſheth vs to praiſe God, euen in our afflictions, how much rather in his graces and blesſings? Wee are therefore to amende two great corruptions that reſt heerein: Some, as hogs that eate acornes vnder an oake, doo neuer ſo much as looke vp whence they come: Thus doo many ſwallowe vp the giftes of God, as the dronkards that drink beere and wine, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taſt the reliſh therof, that with Dauid they may ſaie, <hi>O Lorde thou art good and gracious.</hi> They neuer thinke that theſe benefites doo proceede from the prouidence, goodneſſe, and power of God, that ſo they maye take occaſion to praiſe him. The meditation therefore of this doctrine, which teacheth that it is God that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them meate and drinke, aire to breath, ſtrength, vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and induſtrie to labou:r To bee briefe, that giueth them both ſoule and bodie, and all thinges neceſſarie for the lyfe and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance both of the one &amp; the other.

And this dutie doth Dauid teach vs, almoſt throughout the whole booke of Pſalmes, which is for that cauſe by the Hebrues tearmed, The booke of thankeſgiuing.

And not onely ſo, but likewiſe that God will make both the deuils and the wicked to ſerue to his glorie, and to the benefite and ſaluation of his children. And in deede, as the holy Ghoſt doeth teſtifie, it was the prouidence and definite counſell of God, that the Iewes and Gentiles ſhould perſecute Ieſus Chriſt to the death. And that Sathan ſhould moue the heart of Iudas to betraie Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Act. 2.23. &amp; 4.<hi>27</hi> Iohn 13.2.</note> And in this manner did God fulfill our redemption to his glorie, and the ſaluation of his elect. Beholde therefore how this doctrine miniſtereth wonderfull quiet and contentment to the children of God in all aſſaultes, euen when they finde themſelues at deathes doore. For reſpecting this prouidence of God, they doo hope in him, as Abraham did, beyond all hope, aſſuring themſelues, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſaith, that God is our God, to ſaue vs, &amp; that the gates of death are in the hands of the Lord our God. Thus they doo aſſure them ſelues that God in his prouidence and power wil aſsiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.18 Pſal. 68.21</note> either by meanes ordinarie, as are the ſame, which dayly and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he beſtoweth vpon vs, or extraordinarie, as when for the ſpace of fortie yeeres hee fedde his children of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe, dayly ſending vnto them Manna from heauen, eyther without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie meanes at all,<note place="margin">Deut. 8.3 Exod. 34.28 1.

               <p n="27">27 This doctrine will alſo greatly auaile vs, to reſtraine vs from many iniquities, as from ſeeking meanes condemned by the worde of God, to ſaue our ſelues from affliction and calamitie threatned vnto vs: lykewiſe to bridle vs from vſing anie fraude or deceit in our affayres, or anie badde conſcience for the attaining of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For in as much as it is almightie God, that by his prouidence guideth and gouerneth all things, and man is not to hope for anie bleſsing or proſperitie but from his fauour and good wil: it were extreme folly, euen verie madneſſe, to thinke to proſper by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and prouoking him to anger and wrath. As contrarywiſe, we are not to doubt, but hee guiding all thinges by his prouidence, wyll bleſſe thoſe, who walking plainly, ſimplie, and in a good conſcience, ſhall depende vppon him. This may bee vnto vs a
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:18664:236"/> mightie buckler, to ouercome the daungerous temptations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with otherwiſe wee may bee eaſily drawen to followe the ſinnes and iniquities of thoſe that ſeeme to proſper in wickedneſſe. For knowing that it is from Sathan, whome in theyr wickedneſſe they doo ſerue, that they receiue theyr imaginarie proſperitie (yet by Gods ſuſterance) wee muſt beleeue that it is to them rather a curſe than a bleſsing, conſidering that the onely grace and good will of God is the mother and nurſe of all peace and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus doo wee ſee howe this doctrine of Gods prouidence will in reſpect of the time to come, aſſure vs that hee wyll pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for all our neceſsities, either corporall or ſpirituall: that it wyll miniſter vnto vs a holie reſolution to walke conſtantlye in his obedience, and to ſurmount the apprehenſions of all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences that might by anie meanes befall vs: that it wyll cauſe vs to forbeare all fraude and iniquitie, and to walke in all playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and equitie, and thereby to expect the bleſsing of God: that it will comfort vs in all our afflictions and tribulations that hee ſhall either ſend or laie vppon vs, and induce vs to magnifie him in all his workes, namely, in thoſe benefites and graces which wee doo receiue thorough his greate prouidence and good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
               <p n="28">28 To conclude, when wee ſhall ſee reuolts in religion, hereſie in doctrine, ſchiſmes and troubles in the Church: that they which ſhoulde bee ſhepheardes become Wolues: That by the preaching of the Goſpell ſome are blinded and hardned: That troubles and warres doo inſue the preaching of Ieſus Chriſt, the prince of peace: That the wicked doo oppreſſe the children of God, &amp; account them as the offſcumme of the world, wyth many other lyke matters ſtraunge to the worlde: when (I ſaie) wee ſee all theſe thinges come to paſſe, and doo remember that it was all foreſhewed and ſo ordayned in Gods almightie prouidence, we ſhall take no offence thereat, neyther murmure agaynſt God, or bee faint hearted: but rather reuerencing the workes of God, wee ſhall abide and continue ſteadfaſt in the faith and our due obedience, as knowing that ſith ſuch is the will and pleaſure of God, it cannot bee but good and expedient for his glorie and the ſaluation of his elect. And therefore it appeareth that they which reiect the doctrine of predeſtination and Gods prouidence, are enemies to his glorie, and to the comfort, edification, and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faithfull: ſo there is no doctrine that may or can more

Let vs alſo call to minde, that we muſt offer our bodies a liuely, holy, and acceptable ſacrifice vnto God, which is our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſeruice, and not to forme our ſelues after this worlde,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.19</note> but bee tranſformed by the renuing of our mindes, to the ende wee may proue what is the good, perfect, and acceptable will of God.

               <p>Beholde therefore howe this honour which wee receiue of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb, 13, 16</note> euen to bee kings and prieſts to our God, may be a mighty inducement vnto vs to amend our liues.</p>
               <p n="14">14 There doth yet remaine the office of a Prophet, which alſo doth admoniſh vs to amend, becauſe hee hath reuealed vnto vs all that hee hath knowen of his father,<note place="margin">Iohn 15.15</note> and declared as well what wee muſt doo in obeying him, as what wee are to beleeue to our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And this doth Saint Paul in few words repreſent vnto vs, ſaying: <hi>They are not in Chriſt, neither haue anie portion in the commonwealth of Iſrael, but are straungers to the couenant of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi>

And in that regard doth Ieſus Chriſt denounce agaynſt many townes wherein the Goſpell was preached, a more horrible and terrible iudgement, than againſt Sodome, Gomorrha and other townes that heard the word of the Lorde.

               </head>
               <p>IN the firſt Chapter of the firſt booke, we haue declared that the holy Ghoſt commanding vs to amend, doeth ordinarily vſe two wordes, whereof the one doth ſignifie, <hi>Be ye better aduiſed,</hi> or learne to know your ignorance or fault, and the other as much as if wee ſhould ſaie, <hi>Returne and conuert.</hi> By the firſt the holy Ghoſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is a great folly to offend God, conſidering that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting vs to amend, commandeth vs to be wiſe and aduiſed. And the other confirmeth it to be in truth a great folly: For when God ſaith, <hi>Conuert &amp; returne to me,</hi> namely, by amendement: he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that by tranſgreſsing his law, we go to the deuill, &amp; by amending we turne backe and go from the deuill to the liuing God. And in deed, if anie man liſt to demand what waie the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, fornicators, whoremongers, dronkardes, couetous perſons, dreamers, blaſphemers: and to bee ſhort, all they that giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the world, and to the luſts of the fleſh, doo take: the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is certaine and readie, euen they that take the waie that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to hell, that forſaking life they go to death, and running from God, they draw neere to the deuil. Saint Paul making a catalogue of theſe people, doth reſolutely pronounce,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.10 Rom. 6.23 Deut. 27.26</note> that <hi>they ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God:</hi> alſo, that <hi>the reward of ſinne is death:</hi> and <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that keepeth not the commandements of the law.</hi> And becauſe there are few that take care to obey God, &amp; to amend their liues,<note place="margin">Math. 7.13</note> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt pronounceth, that <hi>broade is the gate and path that leadeth to deſtruction.</hi> As therefore if a man departing from Paris, taketh his waie into Spaine, and yet giueth out that hee wil take his waie through Flanders or Holand, euerie man will ſcorne him as a foole, or take pittie of him as if he were a ſenſeleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that goeth farre amiſſe: euen ſo is it with him, who taking no
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:18664:254"/> courſe to amend, but continuing in offending of God, doth neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles ſay &amp; vphold that he will go to heauen: for euery man may iudge him to be ſenſeleſſe and greatly out of the waie, becauſe he taketh the contrarie courſe which leadeth to hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now if there be no greater madnes or pernitious folly, than by offending God, to take the waie to hell and euerlaſting fire, Ieſus Chriſt in commanding vs to amend, doth iuſtly ſaie: Be ye wiſe &amp; better aduiſed, and conuert &amp; returne to me. And in deed if God ſhould aske the ſinner, Wilt thou amend? Wilt thou go to hel fire, into weeping and gnaſhing of teeth with the deuills? There is no man ſo deſperate but that he will anſwere, No Lorde, God forbid: yet hath not God good cauſe to replie? Why? thou takeſt the way thether, thy workes doo leade to hell and euerlaſting deſtruction, and therefore amend: But how Lord? be better aduiſed: As now thou turneſt thy backe to me, and thy face to the deuill: ſo turne &amp; conuert thou to mee. Where thou goeſt from heauen, and draweſt neere vnto hell, turne backe, leaue the world, the fleſh, and all the corruptions of the ſame, &amp; walking in my commandements amend thy life. Thus turning thy backe to the deuil, &amp; thy face vnto me, going from hell, thou ſhalt come to me the fountaine of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. And in deed ſaith S. Auguſtin, we draw neere vnto God, who is euery where,<note place="margin">Proſper in his ſentences out of Auguſtine Se. 91. Sc. 195</note> not by remouing from place to place, but by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners. For as diſsimilitude ſeparateth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſo doth reſemblance and imitation conioyne vs with him. And what a woe is this, ſaith he, by diſpleaſing God to abandon this ſoueraigne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie which is in all places? Let this commandement therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,</hi> that is to ſaie, Be ye better aduiſed, and conuert vnto me, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and inflame our hearts to amend our liues, and to be wiſe and aduiſed to conuert vnto God. If a marchaunt ſeemeth willing to truſt another that is redie to be banquerout with all his goods, one warning will be inough to reclaime him, ye ſhall not need to praie him to beware, or to alleadge many reaſons to withhold him. The only feare &amp; apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of the loſſe of all his goods wil be reaſon and exhortation ſufficient. What ſhall wee then doo, when Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, Be ye better aduiſed, that is, Amend: and note that by offending God, &amp; ſo taking the waie to hel, we indanger our ſelues, yea, we do euen aſſure our ſelues to looſe both bodies and ſouls for euer? Is it not meere madnes and vngrateful rage, to continue and not to be wiſer and better aduiſed, that wee may conuert to God, and by amendement preſerue our bodies and ſouls vnto life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting?</p>

Firſt, when by the kingdome of heauen is ſignified the bleſſed eſtate and incomprehenſible fely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie that wee ſhall inioy in heauen: therein are wee taught that our eſtate is farre different from the eſtate of bruite beaſtes,

And to them on the left hand hee ſhall ſaie, Depart from me ye curſed into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fyre, which is prepared for the deuill and his Angels, and they ſhal go into euerlasting paines, and the righteous into euerlasting life.</hi> Let vs therefore bee fully reſolued, that the daie will come that ſuch as haue amended theyr liues, increaſing in faith, working in loue, and fructifying in good workes, ſhall bee gathered into the fruition of the kingdome of heauen, and the others into euerlaſting fyre. And in deede, ſith it is ſo, ſayth Saint Auguſtine, that all thinges before propheſied in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in his Epiſt. 42. to Mandarenſ.</note> haue come to paſſe and beene fulfilled in theyr ſeaſon, as the floud, the bondage of the ſeede of Abraham in Egypt, and theyr deliuerie, the captiuitie of Babylon, and the returne from the ſame, the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and all that concerned his paſsion, his reſurrection, and aſcenſion into heauen, his promiſe to ſend the holy Ghoſt to the Apoſtles, the calling of the Gentiles, &amp; other like matters: what reaſon haue we to doubt of this day of iudgement, which hath bin foreſhewed in ſo many paſſages of the holy Scripture?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Neither can we anie way doubt thereof, if we haue anie reaſon or vnderſtanding. For if we beleeue that there is a God (which all nations in the world doo confeſſe) we muſt alſo beleeue that hee is righteous: if he be righteous, hee will reward the righteous that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their liues, &amp; puniſh the diſobedient that are giuen to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes. But this reward or puniſhment is not performed in this life but in part, and that verie ſeldome, as both the Prophet manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth in the 71. pſalme, and experience doth dayly teach. It followeth therefore that after this life there is another, wherin the righteous haue their reward, euen the fruition of the kingdome of heauen, and the diſobedient ſhalbe puniſhed with euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This diſcourſe doth S. Paul confirme in expreſſe words: for he ſeeing the perſecutions of the faithful,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.5</note> and their grieuous afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leaſt they ſhould be ſhaken with ſome opinion that there were no prouidence or iuſtice in God, he vpholdeth, &amp; to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie doth ſhew, that the perſecutions &amp; afflictions that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, were a manifeſt demonſtration of the iuſt iudgment of God, <hi>To the end,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ye may be accounted worthie the kingdome of God, for the which ye do alſo ſuffer. For it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled, rest with vs. But when ſhal that be? Euen when the Lord Ieſus ſhal ſhew himſelfe from heauen with his mightie Angels, In flaming fire, rendering vengeance to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do not know God, &amp; which obey not the

Do they not alſo ſhew what benefites wee haue receiued of the Lord, for the which wee are bound to loue, ſerue, and worſhip him, and withal to amend? How oft doth Moſes and other of the Prophets propound the great benefite of the peoples deliuerance out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, thereby to induce them to obedience?

               <p n="6">6 Yet is there thus much more. The miniſters do propound not onely the benefites receiued, out alſo the promiſes of other moſt excellent and plentifull bleſsings and benefites both bodily and ghoſtly, to thoſe that by amending theyr liues ſhall labour to obey God. And this it were to bee wiſhed, that euerie man would note in the reading of the olde and newe Teſtament, to the ende they might both the better vnderſtand them, and be by them the more earneſtly moued, when they are in the ſermons repreſented vnto vs. For how wonderfull is the goodnes of God, who vouchſaſeth to promiſe vs ſo many benefites if wee amend our liues, that is to ſaie, if we performe the thing whereto we are alreadie bound? If I owe vpon a verie formall bill a hundred crownes, will my creditor to the end to induce me to paie the ſame, faithfully promiſe to giue mee ten times as many more? Yet thus doth God deale with vs. For what is al our obedience and amendement of life, in reſpect of
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:18664:266"/> the benefites that God promiſeth to obey him, whereto we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie bound? If he that is free, bindeth himſelfe to ſerue another, then is it reaſon that his maſter ſhould promiſe him ſome wages &amp; reward for his ſeruice: but we are not free, but alreadie bound to ſerue our God, yet doth he promiſe vs great benefits, if we imploy our ſelues faithfully in his ſeruice by amending our liues. Are not wee then verie ſtubborne againſt God, and enemies to our ſelues, that thus contemne the promiſes of his rewards and benefites to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs? If a Prince ſhould promiſe a tayler or ſhoomaker ſonne thouſand crownes for one yeeres ſeruice, would any man refuſe it? Would not he to whome it were offered or promiſed bee readie to leaue his houſe, his wiſe, his children, and all other things, to goe to ſeruice to ſuch a Lord for one yeere? How vnthankfull or ſenſleſſe are we therefore that will not be otherwiſe wonne and induced to ſerue God, who by ſo many, ſo excellent, and ſo aſſured promiſes doth daily inuite vs thereto?</p>
               <p n="7">7 Beſides the repreſentation of benefites alreadie receiued, and of promiſes of more to come, doo they not alſo propounde in the name of the almightie, righteous, and true God, moſt grieuous and manifolde threatnings, to the end that if we will not by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and fatherly gentleneſſe bee induced to amend,<note place="margin">Leuit. 26.

Neyther need we to open our eyes verie wide, or to vſe any ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, to ſee this corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in men, experience doth but too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew it. And for our more manifeſt conuiction heereof, let vs conſider fiue proofes, which wee may note vppon all the fingers of one of our handes, that we may the better remember them, and ſo take ſome care to correct them. Firſt, wherupon we do firſt think, when we wake, that is, what is neereſt to our hands, for ſometimes euen the care of ſome matter doeth waken vs. If thou findeſt that thy firſt cogitations, when thou doeſt awake, are ſuch as concerne the bodie and this preſent lyfe, and do nothing concerne the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, the dutie, ſaluation, and comfort of thy ſoule, this is one pin vpon the ſleeue, and a pricke in one finger, to make thee to remember that thou careſt more for earth than for heauen, for the bodie than for the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Secondly, Ieſus Chriſt ſayth, that <hi>of the abundaunce of the heart the tongue ſpeaketh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12.34,</note> When therefore thou goeſt to bed, thinke what ſpeech &amp; communication thou haſt had all that daie, ſo ſhalt thou be forced to confeſſe, that peraduenture thou haſt ſpoken little of the kingdome of heauen, or of the ſaluation of thy ſoul: but rather, or at the leaſtwiſe, that the greateſt part, without compariſon, hath concerned the bodie and this preſent life. The third point concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the care and affection that in many doth appeare to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the getting of goods and other the appurtenaunces of this life, than for the obtaining of the kingdome of God &amp; his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes. And in deede, moſt men, and the wiſeſt in the worlde, doo not ſo much as vnderſtand the meaning of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and the righteouſnes thereof, ſo farre are they from ſeeking it, rather than the riches &amp; commodities of the fleſh, wherewith they
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:18664:272"/> be better acquainted, and which naturally they doo more deſire. The fourth reſteth in the care, which without compariſon, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the preſeruation of the bodie and this life preſent, than for the keeping of the ſoule, or anie thing that concerneth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. And indeed al men do take more care to nouriſh the body than the ſoul: alſo to preuent the diſeaſes or wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the bodie rather than of the ſoule. The fifth conſiſteth in this, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as our loue or inclination to any thing is great or ſmall, ſo is our ſorrow for the loſſe thereof more or leſse. If through dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, falling into the fire, we chance to burne our face, it troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs more than when by dronkennes we loſe the image of God, and caſt our ſoules into hell fire. The looſing of our bodie, lyfe, or earthly goods for anie offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by vs, doth without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, more daunt and quaile vs, than the deſert of euerlaſting death and the loſse of the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let vs therefore plainly confeſse the truth, that naturally wee loue the bodie better than the ſoule, &amp; the goods &amp; commodities of this temporal life better than the treſures of eternity. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that in lieu of ſeeking firſt the kingdome of heauen and the righteouſnes thereof, and thereupon expecting that all other things ſhall be giuen vs according to the promiſe of Chriſt, wee contrarywiſe, ſetting the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t before the horſe, doo firſt and much more ſeeke that which concerneth the bodie and this preſent life, than anie thing that toucheth the ſoule &amp; the kingdom of heauen. And yet he that knoweth not that the body is more than the ſoul, hath no ſoule, neither hath anie vnderſtanding or reaſon, and is no man but a beaſt. And he that confeſseth not the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be infinitly better than all the kingdomes of the world, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth himſelfe to bee moſt peruerſe and malitious.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That we may therefore correct theſe corruptions, &amp; ſo amend our liues,<note place="margin">Math. 13.44 &amp; 45.</note> let vs remember that Ieſus Chriſt likeneth the <hi>kingdome of heauen to a treaſure hidde in the field, which when a man hath ſound, he hideth it, and for ioy thereof departeth and ſelleth all that he hath, &amp; buieth that field.</hi> Alſo to <hi>a pearle of great value, for the purchaſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the marchant ſelleth al that he hath.</hi> But what was this ſo excellent treaſure, or pearle of ſo great price? euen the Church or holy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.

This kingdome of heauen therfore muſt we firſt &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeke after, and after the example of thoſe marchants, ſell all we haue, that is to ſaie, forſake all that we account to bee precious

               <p n="10">10 Theſe are ſuch monſtrous opinions, that the very ſhew of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſuffiſe to confound them. Now let vs returne to our purpoſe, and with Ieſus Chriſt conclude to the contrary: namely, that the number of thoſe that ſhalbe ſaued is very ſmall: for if vnto men there be giuen no other name whereby we may be ſaued,<note place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> but only the name of Ieſus Chriſt: ſuch as boaſt that they beleeue in God and obey not Chriſt, who commaundeth that wee ſhould alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, can be no pertakers of the ſaluation that is in him. Likewiſe, if vnto thoſe that know not Chriſt, wee doe adioyne all thoſe that albeit he be preached vnto them,<note place="margin">Iohn 14.1.</note> doe not beleeue in him, neither liue as the members of Chriſt, euery one may eaſilye vnderſtand the truth of his ſentence who is the ſelf truth, namely, that few ſhalbe ſaued, and that in reſpect of the others, it is a ſmall flocke that ſhalbe partakers of the eternall kingdome. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doe we gather two points that ſhould mightily induce vs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our liues. Firſt, that we muſt practiſe the exhortation that Chriſt himſelfe gathereth thereof, when he ſaith: <hi>Labour to enter at the narrow gate:</hi> but how? by putting of the olde man, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelues and the worlde: in breefe, by daylye amendment.<note place="margin">Luke 13.24.</note> Let vs therefore beware of the broad way, and conſequentlye of theſe curſed diſpenſations to offend God: when we are attempted hereto, let vs remember, that as ſin leadeth vnto death, ſo muſt we ſeperate our ſelues from the multitude that walketh in the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction euerlaſting, neither muſt we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thoſe that ſay, all the worlde doeth thus, moſt men doe liue thus, we cannot make a world apart: if thou followeſt this world, &amp; take the broad way, thou ſhalt with the world go into deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Secondly, the more ſtedfaſtly that we vnderſtand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that there ſhalbe few ſaued, the more earneſtly let vs praiſe God, who hath choſen vs to be of that ſmall number, and hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs to bring vs in at the narrowe gate, to be of his euerlaſting kingdome: let vs beholde the multitude that goe by the brode gate to deſtruction, &amp; let the horror of their woe kindle our harts,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:18664:275"/> that we may praiſe God for his great mercy toward vs, and walke cheerefully in the ſtraight way that leadeth to heauen, let vs cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly reiect all deſires of the fleſh, allurements of the worlde, and all other temptations, to the ende that by dayly amendment of life, we may finally enter at the narrow gate that leadeth to the kingdome of eternall glory. Thus we ſee how the conſideration of this title of the kingdome of heauen, attributed to the Church &amp; to the holye miniſterye, to the reſtauration of man, conſiſting in righteouſnes, peac,e and ioy in the holy ghoſt, and to the felicity of the Children of God in heauen, doth admoniſhe and teach vs that we muſt firſt enter into the Church and vſe the holy miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ſecondly, thereby increaſe in faith and amendment of life, and ſo attaine to the fruition of the incomprehenſible felicity and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, prepared in heauen for the children of God.</p>

                  </note> did truely at the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, come very neere vnto man. As concerning the kingdome of glory that is in heauen, we know that our firſt parents Adam and liue, when they had tranſgreſſed the commaundement of God, were driuen out of the garden of Eden, alſo that God placed the Cherubins on the eaſt ſide of the garden, with a flaming ſworde continually mouing, to keep the way to the tree of life. Then God, thereby hauing ſhewed that man was put forth and baniſhed out of heauen and life euerlaſting, by the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the tabernacle, and afterward of the temple in Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, gaue vnto his people ſome figure of a paſſage into heauen, through the Meſsias that was to come. For in that the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the porch, &amp; might haue no acceſſe into the holy ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarye,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.9.</note> the figure of heauen, God gaue them to vnderſtand that they were vnworthy to come in: but in that the high prieſt once in the yeere, did enter with the twelue names of the twelue tribes,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:18664:275"/> vpon his ſhoulders and his breaſt: God thereby ſignified, that when Ieſus Chriſt, figured in this high prieſt, ſhould come, he by his death ſhould open vnto them the gate of heauen, and ſhould enter thereat, not for himſelfe onelie: but as it were carying his people in with him. And thereupon at the death of Chriſt, the vaile of the Temple that ſeperated, and did hide the holy Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, did cleaue and rent to the bottom,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.51. Heb. 9.8.</note> thereby to ſhew that the way of heauen was now open to the members of Ieſus Chriſt, which was not before reuealed: as the Apoſtle ſaieth to the Hebrews. Thus did the kingedome of heauen beginne to be at hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Yet drew it nearer when Ieſus Chriſt riſing from death, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen. For as the high Prieſt, entring into the holy Sanctuarie, vpon his ſhoulders and breſt, carryed the twelue names of the twelue tribes of Iſrael: So Ieſus Chriſt entred not alone into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but we alſo with him, as ſaith Saint Paule,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>That God quickened vs together with Chriſt, and raiſeth vs vp together, and made vs ſit together in the heauenlie places in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place the ſame Apoſtle ſaieth. <hi>If we be children, we are alſo heires, euen the heires of God, and coheyres with Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And this he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to aſſure vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.17.</note> that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo taken poſſeſsion of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that it is not onely for himſelfe, but alſo for vs his coheyres. As if vpon the confiſcation of an inheritance common to many brethren, when the prince afterward maketh a releaſe, the eldeſt brother taketh the poſſeſsion, for aſſurance that himſelfe and his bretheren are reſtored to their goods &amp; the ſame is an aſſurance to the coheires with the eldeſt, that in the perſon of their eldeſt brother themſelues are put in poſſeſsion of the inheritance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all. Thus did the kingedome of heauen draw neare at the comming of Ieſus Chriſt: and this is it that he firſt wiſheth vs to note for our amendment, when he ſaith, <hi>Amend your liues, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The auncient fathers could neuer diſcerne this kingdome but a farre off and very obſcurely.

Howe much rather (I ſay) ſhould we be euen rauiſhed to aſp re to this kingdome, which we ſee open, by denying the world &amp; the fleſh: and all that might keepe vs backe: that by amending our lyues we might increaſe in faith, loue, holyneſſe, &amp; in euery good thing that might be vnto vs as a path, a Chariot &amp; horſe to tranſport vs really into heauen?

But there was not as yet any payment or ſatiſfaction for ſinnes: And therefore theſe ſacrifices were as it were bonds with ſureties, wherein man, the principall debtor,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.14.</note> acknowledgeth the debt, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt vndertooke as a pledge and ſurety.</p>

Looking for and haſtning vnto the comming of the day of God, wherein the heauens being on fire, ſhall be diſsolued, and the elements ſhal melt with heat.
